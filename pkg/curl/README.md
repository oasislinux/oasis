There are a number of non-standard definitions, but they don't seem to be
architecture-specific except for

- `SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T`
- `SIZEOF_INT`
- `SIZEOF_LONG`
- `SIZEOF_LONG_LONG`
- `SIZEOF_OFF_T`
- `SIZEOF_SHORT`
- `SIZEOF_SIZE_T`
- `SIZEOF_TIME_T`

Perhaps all or most of these can eliminated using standard C99 features.
