\fBmpv\fP [options] [file|URL|PLAYLIST|\-]
\fBmpv\fP [options] files
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmpv\fP is a media player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide variety of video
file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types. Special input URL
types are available to read input from a variety of sources other than disk
files. Depending on platform, a variety of different video and audio output
methods are supported.
.sp
Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this man
page.
.SH INTERACTIVE CONTROL
.sp
mpv has a fully configurable, command\-driven control layer which allows you
to control mpv using keyboard, mouse, or remote control (there is no
LIRC support \- configure remotes as input devices instead).
.sp
See the \fB\-\-input\-\fP options for ways to customize it.
.sp
The following listings are not necessarily complete. See \fBetc/input.conf\fP for
a list of default bindings. User \fBinput.conf\fP files and Lua scripts can
define additional key bindings.

.SH USAGE
.sp
Command line arguments starting with \fB\-\fP are interpreted as options,
everything else as filenames or URLs. All options except \fIflag\fP options (or
choice options which include \fByes\fP) require a parameter in the form
\fB\-\-option=value\fP\&.
.sp
One exception is the lone \fB\-\fP (without anything else), which means media data
will be read from stdin. Also, \fB\-\-\fP (without anything else) will make the
player interpret all following arguments as filenames, even if they start with
\fB\-\fP\&. (To play a file named \fB\-\fP, you need to use \fB\&./\-\fP\&.)
.sp
Every \fIflag\fP option has a \fIno\-flag\fP counterpart, e.g. the opposite of the
\fB\-\-fs\fP option is \fB\-\-no\-fs\fP\&. \fB\-\-fs=yes\fP is same as \fB\-\-fs\fP, \fB\-\-fs=no\fP
is the same as \fB\-\-no\-fs\fP\&.
.sp
If an option is marked as \fI(XXX only)\fP, it will only work in combination with
the \fIXXX\fP option or if \fIXXX\fP is compiled in.
.SS Legacy option syntax
.sp
The \fB\-\-option=value\fP syntax is not strictly enforced, and the alternative
legacy syntax \fB\-option value\fP and \fB\-\-option value\fP will also work. This is
mostly  for compatibility with MPlayer. Using these should be avoided. Their
semantics can change any time in the future.
.sp
For example, the alternative syntax will consider an argument following the
option a filename. \fBmpv \-fs no\fP will attempt to play a file named \fBno\fP,
because \fB\-\-fs\fP is a flag option that requires no parameter. If an option
changes and its parameter becomes optional, then a command line using the
alternative syntax will break.
.sp
Currently, the parser makes no difference whether an option starts with \fB\-\-\fP
or a single \fB\-\fP\&. This might also change in the future, and \fB\-\-option value\fP
might always interpret \fBvalue\fP as filename in order to reduce ambiguities.
.SS Escaping spaces and other special characters
.sp
Keep in mind that the shell will partially parse and mangle the arguments you
pass to mpv. For example, you might need to quote or escape options and
filenames:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBmpv "filename with spaces.mkv" \-\-title="window title"\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It gets more complicated if the suboption parser is involved. The suboption
parser puts several options into a single string, and passes them to a
component at once, instead of using multiple options on the level of the
command line.
.sp
The suboption parser can quote strings with \fB"\fP and \fB[...]\fP\&.
Additionally, there is a special form of quoting with \fB%n%\fP described below.
.sp
For example, assume the hypothetical \fBfoo\fP filter can take multiple options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBmpv test.mkv \-\-vf=foo:option1=value1:option2:option3=value3,bar\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This passes \fBoption1\fP and \fBoption3\fP to the \fBfoo\fP filter, with \fBoption2\fP
as flag (implicitly \fBoption2=yes\fP), and adds a \fBbar\fP filter after that. If
an option contains spaces or characters like \fB,\fP or \fB:\fP, you need to quote
them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBmpv \(aq\-\-vf=foo:option1="option value with spaces",bar\(aq\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Shells may actually strip some quotes from the string passed to the commandline,
so the example quotes the string twice, ensuring that mpv receives the \fB"\fP
quotes.
.sp
The \fB[...]\fP form of quotes wraps everything between \fB[\fP and \fB]\fP\&. It\(aqs
useful with shells that don\(aqt interpret these characters in the middle of
an argument (like bash). These quotes are balanced (since mpv 0.9.0): the \fB[\fP
and \fB]\fP nest, and the quote terminates on the last \fB]\fP that has no matching
\fB[\fP within the string. (For example, \fB[a[b]c]\fP results in \fBa[b]c\fP\&.)
.sp
The fixed\-length quoting syntax is intended for use with external
scripts and programs.
.sp
It is started with \fB%\fP and has the following format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
%n%string_of_length_n
.ft P

.IP "Examples"
.sp
\fBmpv \(aq\-\-vf=foo:option1=%11%quoted text\(aq test.avi\fP
.sp
Or in a script:
.sp
\fBmpv \-\-vf=foo:option1=%\(gaexpr length "$NAME"\(ga%"$NAME" test.avi\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Suboptions passed to the client API are also subject to escaping. Using
\fBmpv_set_option_string()\fP is exactly like passing \fB\-\-name=data\fP to the
command line (but without shell processing of the string). Some options
support passing values in a more structured way instead of flat strings, and
can avoid the suboption parsing mess. For example, \fB\-\-vf\fP supports
\fBMPV_FORMAT_NODE\fP, which lets you pass suboptions as a nested data structure
of maps and arrays.
.SS Paths
.sp
Some care must be taken when passing arbitrary paths and filenames to mpv. For
example, paths starting with \fB\-\fP will be interpreted as options. Likewise,
if a path contains the sequence \fB://\fP, the string before that might be
interpreted as protocol prefix, even though \fB://\fP can be part of a legal
UNIX path. To avoid problems with arbitrary paths, you should be sure that
absolute paths passed to mpv start with \fB/\fP, and prefix relative paths with
\fB\&./\fP\&.
.sp
Using the \fBfile://\fP pseudo\-protocol is discouraged, because it involves
strange URL unescaping rules.
.sp
The name \fB\-\fP itself is interpreted as stdin, and will cause mpv to disable
console controls. (Which makes it suitable for playing data piped to stdin.)
.sp
The special argument \fB\-\-\fP can be used to stop mpv from interpreting the
following arguments as options.
.sp
When using the client API, you should strictly avoid using \fBmpv_command_string\fP
for invoking the \fBloadfile\fP command, and instead prefer e.g. \fBmpv_command\fP
to avoid the need for filename escaping.
.sp
For paths passed to suboptions, the situation is further complicated by the
need to escape special characters. To work this around, the path can be
additionally wrapped in the fixed\-length syntax, e.g. \fB%n%string_of_length_n\fP
(see above).
.sp
Some mpv options interpret paths starting with \fB~\fP\&. Currently, the prefix
\fB~~/\fP expands to the mpv configuration directory (usually \fB~/.config/mpv/\fP).
\fB~/\fP expands to the user\(aqs home directory. (The trailing \fB/\fP is always
required.) There are the following paths as well:

.SS Per\-File Options
.sp
When playing multiple files, any option given on the command line usually
affects all files. Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
mpv \-\-a file1.mkv \-\-b file2.mkv \-\-c
.ft P

T}	T{
\fB\-\-a \-\-b \-\-c\fP
T}
_
.TE
.sp
(This is different from MPlayer and mplayer2.)
.sp
Also, if any option is changed at runtime (via input commands), they are not
reset when a new file is played.
.sp
Sometimes, it is useful to change options per\-file. This can be achieved by
adding the special per\-file markers \fB\-\-{\fP and \fB\-\-}\fP\&. (Note that you must
escape these on some shells.) Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mpv \-\-a file1.mkv \-\-b \-\-\e{ \-\-c file2.mkv \-\-d file3.mkv \-\-e \-\-\e} file4.mkv \-\-f

.TE
.sp
Additionally, any file\-local option changed at runtime is reset when the current
file stops playing. If option \fB\-\-c\fP is changed during playback of
\fBfile2.mkv\fP, it is reset when advancing to \fBfile3.mkv\fP\&. This only affects
file\-local options. The option \fB\-\-a\fP is never reset here.
.SS List Options
.sp
Some options which store lists of option values can have action suffixes. For
example, you can set a \fB,\fP\-separated list of filters with \fB\-\-vf\fP, but the
option also allows you to append filters with \fB\-\-vf\-append\fP\&.
.sp
Options for filenames do not use \fB,\fP as separator, but \fB:\fP (Unix) or \fB;\fP
(Windows).

.sp
Although some operations allow specifying multiple \fB,\fP\-separated items, using
this is strongly discouraged and deprecated, except for \fB\-set\fP\&.
.sp
Without suffix, the action taken is normally \fB\-set\fP\&.
.sp
Some options (like \fB\-\-sub\-file\fP, \fB\-\-audio\-file\fP, \fB\-\-glsl\-shader\fP) are
aliases for the proper option with \fB\-append\fP action. For example,
\fB\-\-sub\-file\fP is an alias for \fB\-\-sub\-files\-append\fP\&.
.sp
Some options only support a subset of the above.
.sp
Options of this type can be changed at runtime using the \fBchange\-list\fP
command, which takes the suffix as separate operation parameter.
.SS Playing DVDs
.sp
DVDs can be played with the \fBdvd://[title]\fP syntax. The optional
title specifier is a number which selects between separate video
streams on the DVD. If no title is given (\fBdvd://\fP) then the longest
title is selected automatically by the library. This is usually what
you want. mpv does not support DVD menus.
.sp
DVDs which have been copied on to a hard drive or other mounted
filesystem (by e.g. the \fBdvdbackup\fP tool) are accommodated by
specifying the path to the local copy: \fB\-\-dvd\-device=PATH\fP\&.
Alternatively, running \fBmpv PATH\fP should auto\-detect a DVD directory
tree and play the longest title.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DVD library choices
.sp
mpv uses a different default DVD library than MPlayer. MPlayer
uses libdvdread by default, and mpv uses libdvdnav by default.
Both libraries are developed in parallel, but libdvdnav is
intended to support more sophisticated DVD features such as menus
and multi\-angle playback. mpv uses libdvdnav for files specified
as either \fBdvd://...\fP or \fBdvdnav://...\fP\&. To use libdvdread,
which will produce behavior more like MPlayer, specify
\fBdvdread://...\fP instead. Some users have experienced problems
when using libdvdnav, in which playback gets stuck in a DVD menu
stream. These problems are reported to go away when auto\-selecting
the title (\fBdvd://\fP rather than \fBdvd://1\fP) or when using
libdvdread (e.g. \fBdvdread://0\fP). There are also outstanding bugs
in libdvdnav with seeking backwards and forwards in a video
stream. Specify \fBdvdread://...\fP to fix such problems.

DVD subtitles
.sp
DVDs use image\-based subtitles. Image subtitles are implemented as
a bitmap video stream which can be superimposed over the main
movie. mpv\(aqs subtitle styling and positioning options and keyboard
shortcuts generally do not work with image\-based subtitles.
Exceptions include options like \fB\-\-stretch\-dvd\-subs\fP and
\fB\-\-stretch\-image\-subs\-to\-screen\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.SS Location and Syntax
.sp
You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be read every
time mpv is run. The system\-wide configuration file \(aqmpv.conf\(aq is in your
configuration directory (e.g. \fB/etc/mpv\fP or \fB/usr/local/etc/mpv\fP), the
user\-specific one is \fB~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf\fP\&. For details and platform
specifics (in particular Windows paths) see the \fI\%FILES\fP section.
.sp
User\-specific options override system\-wide options and options given on the
command line override either. The syntax of the configuration files is
\fBoption=value\fP\&. Everything after a \fI#\fP is considered a comment. Options
that work without values can be enabled by setting them to \fIyes\fP and disabled by
setting them to \fIno\fP\&. Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

.SS Escaping spaces and special characters
.sp
This is done like with command line options. The shell is not involved here,
but option values still need to be quoted as a whole if it contains certain
characters like spaces. A config entry can be quoted with \fB"\fP,
as well as with the fixed\-length syntax (\fB%n%\fP) mentioned before. This is like
passing the exact contents of the quoted string as command line option. C\-style
escapes are currently _not_ interpreted on this level, although some options do
this manually. (This is a mess and should probably be changed at some point.)
.SS Putting Command Line Options into the Configuration File

Almost all command line options can be put into the configuration file. Here

.SS File\-specific Configuration Files
.sp
You can also write file\-specific configuration files. If you wish to have a
configuration file for a file called \(aqvideo.avi\(aq, create a file named
\(aqvideo.avi.conf\(aq with the file\-specific options in it and put it in
\fB~/.config/mpv/\fP\&. You can also put the configuration file in the same directory
as the file to be played. Both require you to set the \fB\-\-use\-filedir\-conf\fP
option (either on the command line or in your global config file). If a
file\-specific configuration file is found in the same directory, no
file\-specific configuration is loaded from \fB~/.config/mpv\fP\&. In addition, the
\fB\-\-use\-filedir\-conf\fP option enables directory\-specific configuration files.
For this, mpv first tries to load a mpv.conf from the same directory
as the file played and then tries to load any file\-specific configuration.
.SS Profiles
.sp
To ease working with different configurations, profiles can be defined in the
configuration files. A profile starts with its name in square brackets,
e.g. \fB[my\-profile]\fP\&. All following options will be part of the profile. A
description (shown by \fB\-\-profile=help\fP) can be defined with the
\fBprofile\-desc\fP option. To end the profile, start another one or use the
profile name \fBdefault\fP to continue with normal options.
.sp
You can list profiles with \fB\-\-profile=help\fP, and show the contents of a

The profile name follows the schema \fBtype.name\fP, where type can be
\fBprotocol\fP for the input/output protocol in use (see \fB\-\-list\-protocols\fP),
and \fBextension\fP for the extension of the path of the currently played file
(\fInot\fP the file format).
.sp
This feature is very limited, and there are no other auto profiles.
.SH TAKING SCREENSHOTS
.sp
Screenshots of the currently played file can be taken using the \(aqscreenshot\(aq
input mode command, which is by default bound to the \fBs\fP key. Files named
\fBmpv\-shotNNNN.jpg\fP will be saved in the working directory, using the first
available number \- no files will be overwritten. In pseudo\-GUI mode, the
screenshot will be saved somewhere else. See \fI\%PSEUDO GUI MODE\fP\&.
.sp
A screenshot will usually contain the unscaled video contents at the end of the
video filter chain and subtitles. By default, \fBS\fP takes screenshots without
subtitles, while \fBs\fP includes subtitles.
.sp
Unlike with MPlayer, the \fBscreenshot\fP video filter is not required. This
filter was never required in mpv, and has been removed.
.SH TERMINAL STATUS LINE
.sp
During playback, mpv shows the playback status on the terminal. It looks like
something like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBAV: 00:03:12 / 00:24:25 (13%) A\-V: \-0.000\fP
.UNINDENT

.sp
The status line can be overridden with the \fB\-\-term\-status\-msg\fP option.
.sp
The following is a list of things that can show up in the status line. Input
properties, that can be used to get the same information manually, are also
listed.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAV:\fP or \fBV:\fP (video only) or \fBA:\fP (audio only)
.IP \(bu 2
The current time position in \fBHH:MM:SS\fP format (\fBplayback\-time\fP property)
.IP \(bu 2
The total file duration (absent if unknown) (\fBlength\fP property)
.IP \(bu 2
Playback speed, e.g. \(ga\(ga x2.0\(ga\(ga. Only visible if the speed is not normal. This
is the user\-requested speed, and not the actual speed  (usually they should
be the same, unless playback is too slow). (\fBspeed\fP property.)
.IP \(bu 2
Playback percentage, e.g. \fB(13%)\fP\&. How much of the file has been played.
Normally calculated out of playback position and duration, but can fallback
to other methods (like byte position) if these are not available.
(\fBpercent\-pos\fP property.)
.IP \(bu 2
The audio/video sync as \fBA\-V:  0.000\fP\&. This is the difference between
audio and video time. Normally it should be 0 or close to 0. If it\(aqs growing,
it might indicate a playback problem. (\fBavsync\fP property.)
.IP \(bu 2
Total A/V sync change, e.g. \fBct: \-0.417\fP\&. Normally invisible. Can show up
if there is audio "missing", or not enough frames can be dropped. Usually
this will indicate a problem. (\fBtotal\-avsync\-change\fP property.)
.IP \(bu 2
Encoding state in \fB{...}\fP, only shown in encoding mode.
.IP \(bu 2
Display sync state. If display sync is active (\fBdisplay\-sync\-active\fP
property), this shows \fBDS: 2.500/13\fP, where the first number is average
number of vsyncs per video frame (e.g. 2.5 when playing 24Hz videos on 60Hz
screens), which might jitter if the ratio doesn\(aqt round off, or there are
mistimed frames (\fBvsync\-ratio\fP), and the second number of estimated number
of vsyncs which took too long (\fBvo\-delayed\-frame\-count\fP property). The
latter is a heuristic, as it\(aqs generally not possible to determine this with
certainty.
.IP \(bu 2
Dropped frames, e.g. \fBDropped: 4\fP\&. Shows up only if the count is not 0. Can
grow if the video framerate is higher than that of the display, or if video
rendering is too slow. May also be incremented on "hiccups" and when the video
frame couldn\(aqt be displayed on time. (\fBvo\-drop\-frame\-count\fP property.)
If the decoder drops frames, the number of decoder\-dropped frames is appended
to the display as well, e.g.: \fBDropped: 4/34\fP\&. This happens only if
decoder frame dropping is enabled with the \fB\-\-framedrop\fP options.
(\fBdrop\-frame\-count\fP property.)
.IP \(bu 2
Cache state, e.g. \fBCache:  2s+134KB\fP\&. Visible if the stream cache is enabled.
The first value shows the amount of video buffered in the demuxer in seconds,
the second value shows the sum of the demuxer forward cache size and the
\fIadditional\fP data buffered in the stream cache in kilobytes.
(\fBdemuxer\-cache\-duration\fP, \fBdemuxer\-cache\-state\fP, \fBcache\-used\fP
properties.)
.UNINDENT
.SH LOW LATENCY PLAYBACK
.sp
mpv is optimized for normal video playback, meaning it actually tries to buffer
as much data as it seems to make sense. This will increase latency. Reducing
latency is possible only by specifically disabling features which increase
latency.
.sp
The builtin \fBlow\-latency\fP profile tries to apply some of the options which can
reduce latency. You can use  \fB\-\-profile=low\-latency\fP to apply all of them. You
can list the contents with \fB\-\-show\-profile=low\-latency\fP (some of the options
are quite obscure, and may change every mpv release).
.sp
Be aware that some of the options can reduce playback quality.
.sp
Most latency is actually caused by inconvenient timing behavior. You can disable
this with \fB\-\-untimed\fP, but it will likely break, unless the stream has no
audio, and the input feeds data to the player at a constant rate.
.sp
Another common problem is with MJPEG streams. These do not signal the correct
framerate. Using \fB\-\-untimed\fP or \fB\-\-no\-correct\-pts \-\-fps=60\fP might help.
.sp
For livestreams, data can build up due to pausing the stream, due to slightly
lower playback rate, or "buffering" pauses. If the demuxer cache is enabled,
these can be skipped manually. The experimental \fBdrop\-buffers\fP command can
be used to discard any buffered data, though it\(aqs very disruptive.
.sp
In some cases, manually tuning TCP buffer sizes and such can help to reduce
latency.
.sp
Additional options that can be tried:
.INDENT 0.0

\fB\-\-opengl\-glfinish=yes\fP, can reduce buffering in the graphics driver

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Many network protocols are supported, but the protocol prefix must always
be specified. mpv will never attempt to guess whether a filename is
actually a network address. A protocol prefix is always required.
.sp
Note that not all prefixes are documented here. Undocumented prefixes are
either aliases to documented protocols, or are just redirections to
protocols implemented and documented in FFmpeg.
.sp
\fBdata:\fP is supported in FFmpeg (not in Libav), but needs to be in the
format \fBdata://\fP\&. This is done to avoid ambiguity with filenames. You
can also prefix it with \fBlavf://\fP or \fBffmpeg://\fP\&.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
By default, the youtube\-dl hook script (enabled by default for mpv CLI)
only looks at http URLs. Prefixing an URL with \fBytdl://\fP forces it to
be always processed by the script. This can also be used to invoke special
youtube\-dl functionality like playing a video by ID or invoking search.

Play a local file, but assume it\(aqs being appended to. This is useful for
example for files that are currently being downloaded to disk. This will
block playback, and stop playback only if no new data was appended after
a timeout of about 2 seconds.
.sp
Using this is still a bit of a bad idea, because there is no way to detect
if a file is actually being appended, or if it\(aqs still written. If you\(aqre
trying to play the  output of some program, consider using a pipe
(\fBsomething | mpv \-\fP). If it really has to be a file on disk, use tail to

.SH PSEUDO GUI MODE
.sp
mpv has no official GUI, other than the OSC (\fI\%ON SCREEN CONTROLLER\fP), which
is not a full GUI and is not meant to be. However, to compensate for the lack
of expected GUI behavior, mpv will in some cases start with some settings
changed to behave slightly more like a GUI mode.
.sp
Currently this happens only in the following cases:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
if started using the \fBmpv.desktop\fP file on Linux (e.g. started from menus
or file associations provided by desktop environments)

.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
This mode applies options from the builtin profile \fBbuiltin\-pseudo\-gui\fP, but
only if these haven\(aqt been set in the user\(aqs config file or on the command line.
Also, for compatibility with the old pseudo\-gui behavior, the options in the
\fBpseudo\-gui\fP profile are applied unconditionally. In addition, the profile
makes sure to enable the pseudo\-GUI mode, so that \fB\-\-profile=pseudo\-gui\fP
works like in older mpv releases. The profiles are currently defined as follows:

The way mpv uses playlist files via \fB\-\-playlist\fP is not safe against
maliciously constructed files. Such files may trigger harmful actions.
This has been the case for all mpv and MPlayer versions, but
unfortunately this fact was not well documented earlier, and some people
have even misguidedly recommended use of \fB\-\-playlist\fP with untrusted
sources. Do NOT use \fB\-\-playlist\fP with random internet sources or files
you do not trust!
.sp
Playlist can contain entries using other protocols, such as local files,
or (most severely), special protocols like \fBavdevice://\fP, which are
inherently unsafe.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-chapter\-merge\-threshold=<number>\fP
Threshold for merging almost consecutive ordered chapter parts in
milliseconds (default: 100). Some Matroska files with ordered chapters
have inaccurate chapter end timestamps, causing a small gap between the
end of one chapter and the start of the next one when they should match.
If the end of one playback part is less than the given threshold away from
the start of the next one then keep playing video normally over the
chapter change instead of doing a seek.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-chapter\-seek\-threshold=<seconds>\fP
Distance in seconds from the beginning of a chapter within which a backward
chapter seek will go to the previous chapter (default: 5.0). Past this
threshold, a backward chapter seek will go to the beginning of the current
chapter instead. A negative value means always go back to the previous
chapter.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hr\-seek=<no|absolute|yes>\fP
Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such
seeks require decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target
position and so can take some time depending on decoding performance. For
some video formats, precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the
default choice to use for seeks; it is possible to explicitly override that
default in the definition of key bindings and in input commands.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B no
Never use precise seeks.
.TP
.B absolute
Use precise seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the
file, such as a chapter seek, but not for relative seeks like
the default behavior of arrow keys (default).
.TP
.B yes
Use precise seeks whenever possible.
.TP
.B always
Same as \fByes\fP (for compatibility).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset=<seconds>\fP
This option exists to work around failures to do precise seeks (as in
\fB\-\-hr\-seek\fP) caused by bugs or limitations in the demuxers for some file
formats. Some demuxers fail to seek to a keyframe before the given target
position, going to a later position instead. The value of this option is
subtracted from the time stamp given to the demuxer. Thus, if you set this
option to 1.5 and try to do a precise seek to 60 seconds, the demuxer is
told to seek to time 58.5, which hopefully reduces the chance that it
erroneously goes to some time later than 60 seconds. The downside of
setting this option is that precise seeks become slower, as video between
the earlier demuxer position and the real target may be unnecessarily
decoded.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-framedrop=<yes|no>\fP
Allow the video decoder to drop frames during seek, if these frames are
before the seek target. If this is enabled, precise seeking can be faster,
but if you\(aqre using video filters which modify timestamps or add new
frames, it can lead to precise seeking skipping the target frame. This
e.g. can break frame backstepping when deinterlacing is enabled.
.sp
Default: \fByes\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-index=<mode>\fP
Controls how to seek in files. Note that if the index is missing from a
file, it will be built on the fly by default, so you don\(aqt need to change
this. But it might help with some broken files.

.B \fB\-\-load\-unsafe\-playlists\fP
Load URLs from playlists which are considered unsafe (default: no). This
includes special protocols and anything that doesn\(aqt refer to normal files.
Local files and HTTP links on the other hand are always considered safe.
.sp
Note that \fB\-\-playlist\fP always loads all entries, so you use that instead
if you really have the need for this functionality.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-access\-references=<yes|no>\fP
Follow any references in the file being opened (default: yes). Disabling
this is helpful if the file is automatically scanned (e.g. thumbnail
generation). If the thumbnail scanner for example encounters a playlist
file, which contains network URLs, and the scanner should not open these,
enabling this option will prevent it. This option also disables ordered
chapters, mov reference files, opening of archives, and a number of other
features.
.sp
On older FFmpeg versions, this will not work in some cases. Some FFmpeg
demuxers might not respect this option.
.sp
This option does not prevent opening of paired subtitle files and such. Use
\fB\-\-autoload\-files=no\fP to prevent this.
.sp
This option does not always work if you open non\-files (for example using
\fBdvd://directory\fP would open a whole bunch of files in the given
directory). Prefixing the filename with \fB\&./\fP if it doesn\(aqt start with
a \fB/\fP will avoid this.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-loop\-playlist=<N|inf|force|no>\fP, \fB\-\-loop\-playlist\fP
Loops playback \fBN\fP times. A value of \fB1\fP plays it one time (default),
\fB2\fP two times, etc. \fBinf\fP means forever. \fBno\fP is the same as \fB1\fP and
disables looping. If several files are specified on command line, the
entire playlist is looped. \fB\-\-loop\-playlist\fP is the same as
\fB\-\-loop\-playlist=inf\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBforce\fP mode is like \fBinf\fP, but does not skip playlist entries
which have been marked as failing. This means the player might waste CPU
time trying to loop a file that doesn\(aqt exist. But it might be useful for
playing webradios under very bad network conditions.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-loop\-file=<N|inf|no>\fP, \fB\-\-loop=<N|inf|no>\fP
Loop a single file N times. \fBinf\fP means forever, \fBno\fP means normal
playback. For compatibility, \fB\-\-loop\-file\fP and \fB\-\-loop\-file=yes\fP are
also accepted, and are the same as \fB\-\-loop\-file=inf\fP\&.
.sp
The difference to \fB\-\-loop\-playlist\fP is that this doesn\(aqt loop the playlist,
just the file itself. If the playlist contains only a single file, the
difference between the two option is that this option performs a seek on
loop, instead of reloading the file.
.sp
\fB\-\-loop\fP is an alias for this option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ab\-loop\-a=<time>\fP, \fB\-\-ab\-loop\-b=<time>\fP
Set loop points. If playback passes the \fBb\fP timestamp, it will seek to
the \fBa\fP timestamp. Seeking past the \fBb\fP point doesn\(aqt loop (this is
intentional).
.sp
If both options are set to \fBno\fP or unset, looping is disabled.
Otherwise, the start/end of playback is used if one of the options
is set to \fBno\fP or unset.
.sp
The loop\-points can be adjusted at runtime with the corresponding
properties. See also \fBab\-loop\fP command.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ordered\-chapters\fP, \fB\-\-no\-ordered\-chapters\fP
Enabled by default.
Disable support for Matroska ordered chapters. mpv will not load or
search for video segments from other files, and will also ignore any
chapter order specified for the main file.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ordered\-chapters\-files=<playlist\-file>\fP
Loads the given file as playlist, and tries to use the files contained in
it as reference files when opening a Matroska file that uses ordered
chapters. This overrides the normal mechanism for loading referenced
files by scanning the same directory the main file is located in.
.sp
Useful for loading ordered chapter files that are not located on the local
filesystem, or if the referenced files are in different directories.
.sp
Note: a playlist can be as simple as a text file containing filenames
separated by newlines.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-chapters\-file=<filename>\fP
Load chapters from this file, instead of using the chapter metadata found
in the main file.

.B \fB\-\-config\-dir=<path>\fP
Force a different configuration directory. If this is set, the given

Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is

the display FPS (X11 only, not correct on multi\-monitor systems), or
assumes infinite display FPS if that fails. Drops are indicated in

Use the demuxer reported FPS for frame dropping. This avoids that the
player needs to decode 1 frame in advance, lowering total latency in
effect. This also means that if the demuxer reported FPS is wrong, or
the video filter chain changes FPS (e.g. deinterlacing), then it could
drop too many or not enough frames.
.IP \(bu 2
Disable waiting for the first video frame. Normally the player waits for
the first video frame to be fully rendered before starting playback
properly. Some VOs will lazily initialize stuff when rendering the first

to drop some frames if rendering the first frame takes longer than needed.

\fBauto\fP tries to automatically enable hardware decoding using the first
available method. This still depends what VO you are using. For example,
if you are not using \fB\-\-vo=gpu\fP or \fB\-\-vo=vdpau\fP, vdpau decoding will
never be enabled. Also note that if the first found method doesn\(aqt actually
work, it will always fall back to software decoding, instead of trying the
next method (might matter on some Linux systems).
.sp
\fBauto\-copy\fP selects only modes that copy the video data back to system
memory after decoding. This selects modes like \fBvaapi\-copy\fP (and so on).
If none of these work, hardware decoding is disabled. This mode is always
guaranteed to incur no additional loss compared to software decoding, and
will allow CPU processing with video filters.
.sp
The \fBvaapi\fP mode, if used with \fB\-\-vo=gpu\fP, requires Mesa 11 and most
likely works with Intel GPUs only. It also requires the opengl EGL backend.
.sp
The \fBcuda\fP and \fBcuda\-copy\fP modes provides deinterlacing in the decoder
which is useful as there is no other deinterlacing mechanism in the opengl
output path. To use this deinterlacing you must pass the option:
\fBvd\-lavc\-o=deint=[weave|bob|adaptive]\fP\&.
Pass \fBweave\fP (or leave the option unset) to not attempt any
deinterlacing. \fBcuda\fP should always be preferred unless the \fBgpu\fP
vo is not being used or filters are required.
.sp
\fBnvdec\fP is a newer implementation of CUVID/CUDA decoding, which uses the
FFmpeg decoders for file parsing. Experimental, is known not to correctly
check whether decoding is supported by the hardware at all. Deinterlacing
is not supported. Since this uses FFmpeg\(aqs codec parsers, it is expected
that this generally causes fewer issues than \fBcuda\fP\&.
.sp
Most video filters will not work with hardware decoding as they are
primarily implemented on the CPU. Some exceptions are \fBvdpaupp\fP,
\fBvdpaurb\fP and \fBvavpp\fP\&. See \fI\%VIDEO FILTERS\fP for more details.
.sp
The \fB\&...\-copy\fP modes (e.g. \fBdxva2\-copy\fP) allow you to use hardware
decoding with any VO, backend or filter. Because these copy the decoded
video back to system RAM, they\(aqre likely less efficient than the direct
modes (like e.g. \fBdxva2\fP), and probably not more efficient than software
decoding except for some codecs (e.g. HEVC).

.IP "Quality reduction with hardware decoding"
.sp
In theory, hardware decoding does not reduce video quality (at least
for the codecs h264 and HEVC). However, due to restrictions in video
output APIs, as well as bugs in the actual hardware decoders, there can
be some loss, or even blatantly incorrect results.
.sp
In some cases, RGB conversion is forced, which means the RGB conversion
is performed by the hardware decoding API, instead of the shaders
used by \fB\-\-vo=gpu\fP\&. This means certain colorspaces may not display
correctly, and certain filtering (such as debanding) cannot be applied
in an ideal way. This will also usually force the use of low quality
chroma scalers instead of the one specified by \fB\-\-cscale\fP\&. In other
cases, hardware decoding can also reduce the bit depth of the decoded
image, which can introduce banding or precision loss for 10\-bit files.
.sp
\fBvdpau\fP is usually safe. If deinterlacing enabled (or the \fBvdpaupp\fP
video filter is active in general), it forces RGB conversion. The latter
currently does not treat certain colorspaces like BT.2020 correctly
(which is mostly a mpv\-specific restriction). The \fBvdpauprb\fP video
filter retrieves image data without RGB conversion and is safe (but
precludes use of vdpau postprocessing).
.sp
\fBvaapi\fP is safe if the \fBvaapi\-egl\fP backend is indicated in the
logs. If \fBvaapi\-glx\fP is indicated, and the video colorspace is either
BT.601 or BT.709, a forced, low\-quality but correct RGB conversion is
performed. Otherwise, the result will be totally incorrect.
.sp
\fBd3d11va\fP is safe when used with the \fBd3d11\fP backend. If used with
\fBangle\fP is it usually safe, except that 10 bit input (HEVC main 10
profiles) will be rounded down to 8 bits, which will result in reduced
quality. Also note that with very old ANGLE builds (without
\fBEGL_KHR_stream path\fP,) all input will be converted to RGB.
.sp
\fBdxva2\fP is not safe. It appears to always use BT.601 for forced RGB
conversion, but actual behavior depends on the GPU drivers. Some drivers
appear to convert to limited range RGB, which gives a faded appearance.
In addition to driver\-specific behavior, global system settings might
affect this additionally. This can give incorrect results even with
completely ordinary video sources.
.sp
\fBrpi\fP always uses the hardware overlay renderer, even with
\fB\-\-vo=gpu\fP\&.
.sp
\fBcuda\fP should be safe, but it has been reported to corrupt the
timestamps causing glitched, flashing frames on some files. It can also
sometimes cause massive framedrops for unknown reasons. Caution is
advised.
.sp
\fBcrystalhd\fP is not safe. It always converts to 4:2:2 YUV, which
may be lossy, depending on how chroma sub\-sampling is done during
conversion. It also discards the top left pixel of each frame for
some reason.
.sp
All other methods, in particular the copy\-back methods (like
\fBdxva2\-copy\fP etc.) should hopefully be safe, although they can still
cause random decoding issues. At the very least, they shouldn\(aqt affect
the colors of the image.
.sp
In particular, \fBauto\-copy\fP will only select "safe" modes
(although potentially slower than other methods), but there\(aqs still no
guarantee the chosen hardware decoder will actually work correctly.
.sp
In general, it\(aqs very strongly advised to avoid hardware decoding
unless \fBabsolutely\fP necessary, i.e. if your CPU is insufficient to
decode the file in questions. If you run into any weird decoding issues,
frame glitches or discoloration, and you have \fB\-\-hwdec\fP turned on,
the first thing you should try is disabling it.

This option is for troubleshooting hwdec interop issues. Since it\(aqs a

.sp
This is useful for the \fBgpu\fP and \fBopengl\-cb\fP VOs for selecting which
hwdec interop context to use exactly. Effectively it also can be used
to block loading of certain backends.
.sp
If set to \fBauto\fP (default), the behavior depends on the VO: for \fBgpu\fP,
it does nothing, and the interop context is loaded on demand (when the
decoder probes for \fB\-\-hwdec\fP support). For \fBopengl\-cb\fP, which has
has no on\-demand loading, this is equivalent to \fBall\fP\&.
.sp
The empty string is equivalent to \fBauto\fP\&.

If set to \fBall\fP, it attempts to load all interop contexts at GL context

Other than that, a specific backend can be set, and the list of them can
be queried with \fBhelp\fP (mpv CLI only).

Some implementations might support multiple formats. In particular,

The mode \fBmono\fP is an alias to \fBml\fP, which refers to the left frame in

\fB\-\-video\-align\-y=\-1\fP would move the video to the top of the screen

.UNINDENT

If a list of layouts is given, each item can be either an explicit channel
layout name (like \fB5.1\fP), or a channel number. Channel numbers refer to
default layouts, e.g. 2 channels refer to stereo, 6 refers to 5.1.

See \fB\-\-audio\-channels=help\fP output for defined default layouts. This also
lists speaker names, which can be used to express arbitrary channel
layouts (e.g. \fBfl\-fr\-lfe\fP is 2.1).
.sp
If the list of channel layouts has only 1 item, the decoder is asked to
produce according output. This sometimes triggers decoder\-downmix, which
might be different from the normal mpv downmix. (Only some decoders support
remixing audio, like AC\-3, AAC or DTS. You can use \fB\-\-ad\-lavc\-downmix=no\fP
to make the decoder always output its native layout.) One consequence is
that \fB\-\-audio\-channels=stereo\fP triggers decoder downmix, while \fBauto\fP
or \fBauto\-safe\fP never will, even if they end up selecting stereo. This
happens because the decision whether to use decoder downmix happens long
before the audio device is opened.
.sp
If the channel layout of the media file (i.e. the decoder) and the AO\(aqs
channel layout don\(aqt match, mpv will attempt to insert a conversion filter.
You may need to change the channel layout of the system mixer to achieve
your desired output as mpv does not have control over it. Another

The audio device is opened using parameters chosen for the first

means that if the first file for example has a low sample rate, then
the following files may get resampled to the same low sample rate,
resulting in reduced sound quality. If you play files with different
parameters, consider using options such as \fB\-\-audio\-samplerate\fP
and \fB\-\-audio\-format\fP to explicitly select what the shared output
format will be.
.TP
.B weak
Normally, the audio device is kept open (using the format it was
first initialized with). If the audio format the decoder output
changes, the audio device is closed and reopened. This means that
you will normally get gapless audio with files that were encoded
using the same settings, but might not be gapless in other cases.
The exact conditions under which the audio device is kept open is

introduce additional issues on playback speed change, and block the

Cash\-grab consumer audio hardware (such as A/V receivers) often ignore
initial audio sent over HDMI. This can happen every time audio over HDMI
is stopped and resumed. In order to compensate for this, you can enable
this option to not to stop and restart audio on seeks, and fill the gaps

silence is played while paused. Note that if no audio track is selected,

.B \fB\-\-sub\-ass\-vsfilter\-aspect\-compat=<yes|no>\fP
Stretch SSA/ASS subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for compatibility
with traditional VSFilter behavior. This switch has no effect when the
video is stored with square pixels.
.sp
The renderer historically most commonly used for the SSA/ASS subtitle
formats, VSFilter, had questionable behavior that resulted in subtitles
being stretched too if the video was stored in anamorphic format that
required scaling for display.  This behavior is usually undesirable and
newer VSFilter versions may behave differently. However, many existing
scripts compensate for the stretching by modifying things in the opposite
direction.  Thus, if such scripts are displayed "correctly", they will not
appear as intended.  This switch enables emulation of the old VSFilter
behavior (undesirable but expected by many existing scripts).
.sp
Enabled by default.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sub\-ass\-vsfilter\-blur\-compat=<yes|no>\fP
Scale \fB\eblur\fP tags by video resolution instead of script resolution
(enabled by default). This is bug in VSFilter, which according to some,
can\(aqt be fixed anymore in the name of compatibility.
.sp
Note that this uses the actual video resolution for calculating the
offset scale factor, not what the video filter chain or the video output
use.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sub\-ass\-vsfilter\-color\-compat=<basic|full|force\-601|no>\fP
Mangle colors like (xy\-)vsfilter do (default: basic). Historically, VSFilter
was not color space aware. This was no problem as long as the color space
used for SD video (BT.601) was used. But when everything switched to HD
(BT.709), VSFilter was still converting RGB colors to BT.601, rendered
them into the video frame, and handled the frame to the video output, which
would use BT.709 for conversion to RGB. The result were mangled subtitle
colors. Later on, bad hacks were added on top of the ASS format to control
how colors are to be mangled.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B basic
Handle only BT.601\->BT.709 mangling, if the subtitles seem to
indicate that this is required (default).
.TP
.B full
Handle the full \fBYCbCr Matrix\fP header with all video color spaces
supported by libass and mpv. This might lead to bad breakages in
corner cases and is not strictly needed for compatibility
(hopefully), which is why this is not default.
.TP
.B force\-601
Force BT.601\->BT.709 mangling, regardless of subtitle headers
or video color space.
.TP
.B no
Disable color mangling completely. All colors are RGB.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Choosing anything other than \fBno\fP will make the subtitle color depend on
the video color space, and it\(aqs for example in theory not possible to reuse
a subtitle script with another video file. The \fB\-\-sub\-ass\-override\fP
option doesn\(aqt affect how this option is interpreted.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-stretch\-dvd\-subs=<yes|no>\fP
Stretch DVD subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for better looking
fonts on badly mastered DVDs. This switch has no effect when the
video is stored with square pixels \- which for DVD input cannot be the case
though.
.sp
Many studios tend to use bitmap fonts designed for square pixels when
authoring DVDs, causing the fonts to look stretched on playback on DVD
players. This option fixes them, however at the price of possibly
misaligning some subtitles (e.g. sign translations).
.sp
Disabled by default.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-stretch\-image\-subs\-to\-screen=<yes|no>\fP
Stretch DVD and other image subtitles to the screen, ignoring the video
margins. This has a similar effect as \fB\-\-sub\-use\-margins\fP for text
subtitles, except that the text itself will be stretched, not only just
repositioned. (At least in general it is unavoidable, as an image bitmap
can in theory consist of a single bitmap covering the whole screen, and
the player won\(aqt know where exactly the text parts are located.)
.sp
This option does not display subtitles correctly. Use with care.
.sp
Disabled by default.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-image\-subs\-video\-resolution=<yes|no>\fP
Override the image subtitle resolution with the video resolution
(default: no). Normally, the subtitle canvas is fit into the video canvas
(e.g. letterboxed). Setting this option uses the video size as subtitle
canvas size. Can be useful to test broken subtitles, which often happen
when the video was trancoded, while attempting to keep the old subtitles.

Unlike \fB\-\-keep\-open\fP, the player is not paused, but simply continues
playback until the time has elapsed. (It should not use any resources

This affects image files, which are defined as having only 1 video frame

Setting \fB\-\-image\-display\-duration\fP hides the OSC and does not track
playback time on the command\-line output, and also does not duplicate

.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-mkv\-subtitle\-preroll=<yes|index|no>\fP, \fB\-\-mkv\-subtitle\-preroll\fP
Try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere. Normally,
it can happen that the subtitle at the seek target is not shown due to how
some container file formats are designed. The subtitles appear only if
seeking before or exactly to the position a subtitle first appears. To
make this worse, subtitles are often timed to appear a very small amount
before the associated video frame, so that seeking to the video frame
typically does not demux the subtitle at that position.
.sp
Enabling this option makes the demuxer start reading data a bit before the
seek target, so that subtitles appear correctly. Note that this makes
seeking slower, and is not guaranteed to always work. It only works if the
subtitle is close enough to the seek target.
.sp
Works with the internal Matroska demuxer only. Always enabled for absolute
and hr\-seeks, and this option changes behavior with relative or imprecise
seeks only.
.sp
You can use the \fB\-\-demuxer\-mkv\-subtitle\-preroll\-secs\fP option to specify
how much data the demuxer should pre\-read at most in order to find subtitle
packets that may overlap. Setting this to 0 will effectively disable this
preroll mechanism. Setting a very large value can make seeking very slow,
and an extremely large value would completely reread the entire file from
start to seek target on every seek \- seeking can become slower towards the
end of the file. The details are messy, and the value is actually rounded
down to the cluster with the previous video keyframe.
.sp
Some files, especially files muxed with newer mkvmerge versions, have
information embedded that can be used to determine what subtitle packets
overlap with a seek target. In these cases, mpv will reduce the amount
of data read to a minimum. (Although it will still read \fIall\fP data between
the cluster that contains the first wanted subtitle packet, and the seek
target.) If the \fBindex\fP choice (which is the default) is specified, then
prerolling will be done only if this information is actually available. If
this method is used, the maximum amount of data to skip can be additionally
controlled by \fB\-\-demuxer\-mkv\-subtitle\-preroll\-secs\-index\fP (it still uses
the value of the option without \fB\-index\fP if that is higher).
.sp
See also \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset\fP option. This option can achieve a
similar effect, but only if hr\-seek is active. It works with any demuxer,
but makes seeking much slower, as it has to decode audio and video data

broken files is much worse. So don\(aqt use this option.

Set the video codec instead of selecting the rawvideo codec when using

Frame size in bytes when using \fB\-\-demuxer=rawvideo\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-max\-bytes=<bytesize>\fP
This controls how much the demuxer is allowed to buffer ahead. The demuxer
will normally try to read ahead as much as necessary, or as much is
requested with \fB\-\-demuxer\-readahead\-secs\fP\&. The option can be used to
restrict the maximum readahead. This limits excessive readahead in case of
broken files or desynced playback. The demuxer will stop reading additional
packets as soon as one of the limits is reached. (The limits still can be
slightly overstepped due to technical reasons.)
.sp
Set these limits higher if you get a packet queue overflow warning, and
you think normal playback would be possible with a larger packet queue.
.sp
See \fB\-\-list\-options\fP for defaults and value range. \fB<bytesize>\fP options
accept suffixes such as \fBKiB\fP and \fBMiB\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-max\-back\-bytes=<bytesize>\fP
This controls how much past data the demuxer is allowed to preserve. This
is useful only if the \fB\-\-demuxer\-seekable\-cache\fP option is enabled.
Unlike the forward cache, there is no control how many seconds are actually
cached \- it will simply use as much memory this option allows. Setting this
option to 0 will strictly disable any back buffer, but this will lead to
the situation that the forward seek range starts after the current playback
position (as it removes past packets that are seek points).
.sp
Keep in mind that other buffers in the player (like decoders) will cause the
demuxer to cache "future" frames in the back buffer, which can skew the
impression about how much data the backbuffer contains.
.sp
See \fB\-\-list\-options\fP for defaults and value range.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-seekable\-cache=<yes|no|auto>\fP
This controls whether seeking can use the demuxer cache (default: auto). If
enabled, short seek offsets will not trigger a low level demuxer seek
(which means for example that slow network round trips or FFmpeg seek bugs
can be avoided). If a seek cannot happen within the cached range, a low
level seek will be triggered. Seeking outside of the cache will start a new
cached range, but can discard the old cache range if the demuxer exhibits
certain unsupported behavior.
.sp
Keep in mind that some events can flush the cache or force a low level
seek anyway, such as switching tracks, or attempting to seek before the
start or after the end of the file.
.sp
The special value \fBauto\fP means \fByes\fP in the same situation as
\fB\-\-cache\-secs\fP is used (i.e. when the stream appears to be a network
stream or the stream cache is enabled).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-thread=<yes|no>\fP
Run the demuxer in a separate thread, and let it prefetch a certain amount
of packets (default: yes). Having this enabled leads to smoother playback,
enables features like prefetching, and prevents that stuck network freezes
the player. On the other hand, it can add overhead, or the background
prefetching can hog CPU resources.
.sp
Disabling this option is not recommended. Use it for debugging only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-demuxer\-readahead\-secs=<seconds>\fP
If \fB\-\-demuxer\-thread\fP is enabled, this controls how much the demuxer
should buffer ahead in seconds (default: 1). As long as no packet has
a timestamp difference higher than the readahead amount relative to the
last packet returned to the decoder, the demuxer keeps reading.
.sp
Note that the \fB\-\-cache\-secs\fP option will override this value if a cache
is enabled, and the value is larger.
.sp
(This value tends to be fuzzy, because many file formats don\(aqt store linear
timestamps.)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-prefetch\-playlist=<yes|no>\fP
Prefetch next playlist entry while playback of the current entry is ending
(default: no). This merely opens the URL of the next playlist entry as soon
as the current URL is fully read.
.sp
This does \fBnot\fP work with URLs resolved by the \fByoutube\-dl\fP wrapper,
and it won\(aqt.
.sp
This does not affect HLS (\fB\&.m3u8\fP URLs) \- HLS prefetching depends on the
demuxer cache settings and is on by default.
.sp
This can give subtly wrong results if per\-file options are used, or if
options are changed in the time window between prefetching start and next
file played.
.sp
This can occasionally make wrong prefetching decisions. For example, it
can\(aqt predict whether you go backwards in the playlist, and assumes you
won\(aqt edit the playlist.
.sp
Highly experimental.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-force\-seekable=<yes|no>\fP
If the player thinks that the media is not seekable (e.g. playing from a
pipe, or it\(aqs an http stream with a server that doesn\(aqt support range
requests), seeking will be disabled. This option can forcibly enable it.
For seeks within the cache, there\(aqs a good chance of success.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-input\-key\-fifo\-size=<2\-65000>\fP
Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7). If it
is too small, some events may be lost. The main disadvantage of setting it
to a very large value is that if you hold down a key triggering some
particularly slow command then the player may be unresponsive while it
processes all the queued commands.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-input\-test\fP
Input test mode. Instead of executing commands on key presses, mpv
will show the keys and the bound commands on the OSD. Has to be used
with a dummy video, and the normal ways to quit the player will not
work (key bindings that normally quit will be shown on OSD only, just
like any other binding). See \fI\%INPUT.CONF\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-input\-file=<filename>\fP
Read commands from the given file. Mostly useful with a FIFO. Since

automatically enabled when \fB\-\fP is found on the command line. There are
situations where you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open

.B \fB\-\-input\-ipc\-server=<filename>\fP
Enable the IPC support and create the listening socket at the given path.
.sp
On Linux and Unix, the given path is a regular filesystem path. On Windows,
named pipes are used, so the path refers to the pipe namespace
(\fB\e\e.\epipe\e<name>\fP). If the \fB\e\e.\epipe\e\fP prefix is missing, mpv will add
it automatically before creating the pipe, so
\fB\-\-input\-ipc\-server=/tmp/mpv\-socket\fP and
\fB\-\-input\-ipc\-server=\e\e.\epipe\etmp\empv\-socket\fP are equivalent for IPC on

.TP
.B \fB\-\-input\-vo\-keyboard=<yes|no>\fP
Disable all keyboard input on for VOs which can\(aqt participate in proper
keyboard input dispatching. May not affect all VOs. Generally useful for
embedding only.
.sp
On X11, a sub\-window with input enabled grabs all keyboard input as long
as it is 1. a child of a focused window, and 2. the mouse is inside of
the sub\-window. It can steal away all keyboard input from the
application embedding the mpv window, and on the other hand, the mpv
window will receive no input if the mouse is outside of the mpv window,
even though mpv has focus. Modern toolkits work around this weird X11
behavior, but naively embedding foreign windows breaks it.
.sp
The only way to handle this reasonably is using the XEmbed protocol, which
was designed to solve these problems. GTK provides \fBGtkSocket\fP, which
supports XEmbed. Qt doesn\(aqt seem to provide anything working in newer
versions.
.sp
If the embedder supports XEmbed, input should work with default settings
and with this option disabled. Note that \fBinput\-default\-bindings\fP is
disabled by default in libmpv as well \- it should be enabled if you want
the mpv default key bindings.

If the directory does not exist, it is created on the first screenshot. If
it is not a directory, an error is generated when trying to write a

.B \fB\-\-screenshot\-jpeg\-quality=<0\-100>\fP
Set the JPEG quality level. Higher means better quality. The default is 90.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-screenshot\-jpeg\-source\-chroma=<yes|no>\fP
Write JPEG files with the same chroma subsampling as the video

.TP
.B \fB\-\-screenshot\-png\-compression=<0\-9>\fP
Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. This will
affect the file size of the written screenshot file and the time it takes
to write a screenshot. Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to
interrupt playback. The default is 7.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-screenshot\-png\-filter=<0\-5>\fP
Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is "sub", 2 is
"up", 3 is "average", 4 is "Paeth", and 5 is "mixed". This affects the level
of compression that can be achieved. For most images, "mixed" achieves the
best compression ratio, hence it is the default.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-audio\-resample\-cutoff=<cutoff>\fP
Cutoff frequency (0.0\-1.0), default set depending upon filter length.
.TP

If set then filters will be linearly interpolated between polyphase
entries. (default: no)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-audio\-normalize\-downmix=<yes|no>\fP
Enable/disable normalization if surround audio is downmixed to stereo
(default: no). If this is disabled, downmix can cause clipping. If it\(aqs
enabled, the output might be too quiet. It depends on the source audio.
.sp
Technically, this changes the \fBnormalize\fP suboption of the
\fBlavrresample\fP audio filter, which performs the downmixing.
.sp
If downmix happens outside of mpv for some reason, or in the decoder
(decoder downmixing), or in the audio output (system mixer), this has no
effect.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-audio\-resample\-max\-output\-size=<length>\fP
Limit maximum size of audio frames filtered at once, in ms (default: 40).
The output size size is limited in order to make resample speed changes
react faster. This is necessary especially if decoders or filters output
very large frame sizes (like some lossless codecs or some DRC filters).
This option does not affect the resampling algorithm in any way.
.sp
For testing/debugging only. Can be removed or changed any time.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache=<kBytes|yes|no|auto>\fP
Set the size of the cache in kilobytes, disable it with \fBno\fP, or
automatically enable it if needed with \fBauto\fP (default: \fBauto\fP).
With \fBauto\fP, the cache will usually be enabled for network streams,
using the size set by \fB\-\-cache\-default\fP\&. With \fByes\fP, the cache will
always be enabled with the size set by \fB\-\-cache\-default\fP (unless the
stream cannot be cached, or \fB\-\-cache\-default\fP disables caching).
.sp
May be useful when playing files from slow media, but can also have
negative effects, especially with file formats that require a lot of
seeking, such as MP4.
.sp
Note that half the cache size will be used to allow fast seeking back. This
is also the reason why a full cache is usually not reported as 100% full.
The cache fill display does not include the part of the cache reserved for
seeking back. The actual maximum percentage will usually be the ratio
between readahead and backbuffer sizes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-default=<kBytes|no>\fP
Set the size of the cache in kilobytes (default: 10000 KB). Using \fBno\fP
will not automatically enable the cache e.g. when playing from a network
stream. Note that using \fB\-\-cache\fP will always override this option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-initial=<kBytes>\fP
Playback will start when the cache has been filled up with this many
kilobytes of data (default: 0).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-seek\-min=<kBytes>\fP
If a seek is to be made to a position within \fB<kBytes>\fP of the cache
size from the current position, mpv will wait for the cache to be
filled to this position rather than performing a stream seek (default:
500).
.sp
This matters for small forward seeks. With slow streams (especially HTTP
streams) there is a tradeoff between skipping the data between current
position and seek destination, or performing an actual seek. Depending
on the situation, either of these might be slower than the other method.
This option allows control over this.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-backbuffer=<kBytes>\fP
Size of the cache back buffer (default: 10000 KB). This will add to the total
cache size, and reserved the amount for seeking back. The reserved amount
will not be used for readahead, and instead preserves already read data to
enable fast seeking back.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-file=<TMP|path>\fP
Create a cache file on the filesystem.
.sp
There are two ways of using this:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
Passing a path (a filename). The file will always be overwritten. When
the general cache is enabled, this file cache will be used to store
whatever is read from the source stream.
.sp
This will always overwrite the cache file, and you can\(aqt use an existing
cache file to resume playback of a stream. (Technically, mpv wouldn\(aqt
even know which blocks in the file are valid and which not.)
.sp
The resulting file will not necessarily contain all data of the source
stream. For example, if you seek, the parts that were skipped over are
never read and consequently are not written to the cache. The skipped over
parts are filled with zeros. This means that the cache file doesn\(aqt
necessarily correspond to a full download of the source stream.
.sp
Both of these issues could be improved if there is any user interest.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 2. 3
Passing the string \fBTMP\fP\&. This will not be interpreted as filename.
Instead, an invisible temporary file is created. It depends on your
C library where this file is created (usually \fB/tmp/\fP), and whether
filename is visible (the \fBtmpfile()\fP function is used). On some
systems, automatic deletion of the cache file might not be guaranteed.
.sp
If you want to use a file cache, this mode is recommended, because it
doesn\(aqt break ordered chapters or \fB\-\-audio\-file\fP\&. These modes open
multiple cache streams, and using the same file for them obviously
clashes.
.UNINDENT

.B \fB\-\-cache\-file\-size=<kBytes>\fP
Maximum size of the file created with \fB\-\-cache\-file\fP\&. For read accesses
above this size, the cache is simply not used.
.sp
Keep in mind that some use\-cases, like playing ordered chapters with cache
enabled, will actually create multiple cache files, each of which will
use up to this much disk space.
.sp

.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-cache\fP
Turn off input stream caching. See \fB\-\-cache\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-secs=<seconds>\fP
How many seconds of audio/video to prefetch if the cache is active. This
overrides the \fB\-\-demuxer\-readahead\-secs\fP option if and only if the cache
is enabled and the value is larger. The default value is set to something
very high, so the actually achieved readahead will usually be limited by
the value of the \fB\-\-demuxer\-max\-bytes\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-pause=<yes|no>\fP
Whether the player should automatically pause when the cache runs out of
data and stalls decoding/playback (default: yes). If enabled, it will
pause and unpause once more data is available, aka "buffering".
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-pause\-wait=<seconds>\fP
Number of seconds the packet cache should have buffered before starting
playback again if "buffering" was entered (default: 1). This can be used
to control how long the player rebuffers if \fB\-\-cache\-pause\fP is enabled,
and the demuxer underruns. If the given time is higher than the maximum
set with \fB\-\-cache\-secs\fP or  \fB\-\-demuxer\-readahead\-secs\fP, or prefetching
ends before that for some other reason (like file end), playback resumes
earlier.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-pause\-initial=<yes|no>\fP
Enter "buffering" mode before starting playback (default: no). This can be
used to ensure playback starts smoothly, in exchange for waiting some time
to prefetch network data (as controlled by \fB\-\-cache\-pause\-wait\fP). For
example, some common behavior is that playback starts, but network caches
immediately underrun when trying to decode more data as playback progresses.
.sp
Another thing that can happen is that the network prefetching is so CPU
demanding (due to demuxing in the background) that playback drops frames
at first. In these cases, it helps enabling this option, and setting
\fB\-\-cache\-secs\fP and \fB\-\-cache\-pause\-wait\fP to roughly the same value.
.sp
This option also triggers when playback is restarted after seeking.

A file containing the private key for the certificate.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-referrer=<string>\fP
Specify a referrer path or URL for HTTP requests.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-network\-timeout=<seconds>\fP
Specify the network timeout in seconds. This affects at least HTTP. The
special value 0 (default) uses the FFmpeg/Libav defaults. If a protocol
is used which does not support timeouts, this option is silently ignored.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This breaks the RTSP protocol, because of inconsistent FFmpeg API
regarding its internal timeout option. Not only does the RTSP timeout
option accept different units (seconds instead of microseconds, causing
mpv to pass it huge values), it will also overflow FFmpeg internal
calculations. The worst is that merely setting the option will put RTSP
into listening mode, which breaks any client uses. Do not use this
option with RTSP URLs.

leaves the decision to libavformat.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hls\-bitrate=<no|min|max|<rate>>\fP
If HLS streams are played, this option controls what streams are selected
by default. The option allows the following parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B no
Don\(aqt do anything special. Typically, this will simply pick the
first audio/video streams it can find.
.TP
.B min
Pick the streams with the lowest bitrate.

Same, but highest bitrate. (Default.)
.UNINDENT

Additionally, if the option is a number, the stream with the highest rate
equal or below the option value is selected.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-dvbin\-card=<1\-4>\fP
Specifies using card number 1\-4 (default: 1).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dvbin\-file=<filename>\fP
Instructs mpv to read the channels list from \fB<filename>\fP\&. The default is
in the mpv configuration directory (usually \fB~/.config/mpv\fP) with the
filename \fBchannels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc}\fP (based on your card type) or
\fBchannels.conf\fP as a last resort.
For DVB\-S/2 cards, a VDR 1.7.x format channel list is recommended
as it allows tuning to DVB\-S2 channels, enabling subtitles and
decoding the PMT (which largely improves the demuxing).
Classic mplayer format channel lists are still supported (without
these improvements), and for other card types, only limited VDR
format channel list support is implemented (patches welcome).
For channels with dynamic PID switching or incomplete
\fBchannels.conf\fP, \fB\-\-dvbin\-full\-transponder\fP or the magic PID
\fB8192\fP are recommended.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dvbin\-timeout=<1\-30>\fP
Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to tune a frequency before
giving up (default: 30).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dvbin\-full\-transponder=<yes|no>\fP
Apply no filters on program PIDs, only tune to frequency and pass full
transponder to demuxer.
The player frontend selects the streams from the full TS in this case,
so the program which is shown initially may not match the chosen channel.
Switching between the programs is possible by cycling the \fBprogram\fP
property.
This is useful to record multiple programs on a single transponder,
or to work around issues in the \fBchannels.conf\fP\&.
It is also recommended to use this for channels which switch PIDs
on\-the\-fly, e.g. for regional news.

Deprecated, use \fB\-\-audio\-device\fP (requires \fBalsa/\fP prefix).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-resample=yes\fP
Enable ALSA resampling plugin. (This is disabled by default, because
some drivers report incorrect audio delay in some cases.)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-mixer\-device=<device>\fP
Set the mixer device used with \fBao\-volume\fP (default: \fBdefault\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-mixer\-name=<name>\fP
Set the name of the mixer element (default: \fBMaster\fP). This is for

.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-mixer\-index=<number>\fP
Set the index of the mixer channel (default: 0). Consider the output of

name of the element.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-non\-interleaved\fP
Allow output of non\-interleaved formats (if the audio decoder uses
this format). Currently disabled by default, because some popular
ALSA plugins are utterly broken with non\-interleaved formats.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-ignore\-chmap\fP
Don\(aqt read or set the channel map of the ALSA device \- only request the
required number of channels, and then pass the audio as\-is to it. This
option most likely should not be used. It can be useful for debugging,
or for static setups with a specially engineered ALSA configuration (in
this case you should always force the same layout with \fB\-\-audio\-channels\fP,
or it will work only for files which use the layout implicit to your
ALSA device).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-alsa\-buffer\-time=<microseconds>\fP
Set the requested buffer time in microseconds. A value of 0 skips requesting
anything from the ALSA API. This and the \fB\-\-alsa\-periods\fP option uses the
ALSA \fBnear\fP functions to set the requested parameters. If doing so results
in an empty configuration set, setting these parameters is skipped.

Both options control the buffer size. A low buffer size can lead to higher
CPU usage and audio dropouts, while a high buffer size can lead to higher

.TP
.B \fBbilinear\fP
Bilinear hardware texture filtering (fastest, very low quality). This
is the default for compatibility reasons.
.TP
.B \fBspline36\fP
Mid quality and speed. This is the default when using \fBgpu\-hq\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBlanczos\fP
Lanczos scaling. Provides mid quality and speed. Generally worse than
\fBspline36\fP, but it results in a slightly sharper image which is good
for some content types. The number of taps can be controlled with
\fBscale\-radius\fP, but is best left unchanged.
.sp
(This filter is an alias for \fBsinc\fP\-windowed \fBsinc\fP)
.TP
.B \fBewa_lanczos\fP
Elliptic weighted average Lanczos scaling. Also known as Jinc.
Relatively slow, but very good quality. The radius can be controlled
with \fBscale\-radius\fP\&. Increasing the radius makes the filter sharper
but adds more ringing.
.sp
(This filter is an alias for \fBjinc\fP\-windowed \fBjinc\fP)
.TP
.B \fBewa_lanczossharp\fP
A slightly sharpened version of ewa_lanczos, preconfigured to use an
ideal radius and parameter. If your hardware can run it, this is
probably what you should use by default.
.TP
.B \fBmitchell\fP
Mitchell\-Netravali. The \fBB\fP and \fBC\fP parameters can be set with
\fB\-\-scale\-param1\fP and \fB\-\-scale\-param2\fP\&. This filter is very good at
downscaling (see \fB\-\-dscale\fP).
.TP
.B \fBoversample\fP
A version of nearest neighbour that (naively) oversamples pixels, so
that pixels overlapping edges get linearly interpolated instead of
rounded. This essentially removes the small imperfections and judder
artifacts caused by nearest\-neighbour interpolation, in exchange for
adding some blur. This filter is good at temporal interpolation, and
also known as "smoothmotion" (see \fB\-\-tscale\fP).

.TP
.B \fB\-\-dscale=<filter>\fP
Like \fB\-\-scale\fP, but apply these filters on downscaling instead. If this
option is unset, the filter implied by \fB\-\-scale\fP will be applied.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tscale=<filter>\fP
The filter used for interpolating the temporal axis (frames). This is only
used if \fB\-\-interpolation\fP is enabled. The only valid choices for
\fB\-\-tscale\fP are separable convolution filters (use \fB\-\-tscale=help\fP to

Common \fB\-\-tscale\fP choices include \fBoversample\fP, \fBlinear\fP,
\fBcatmull_rom\fP, \fBmitchell\fP, \fBgaussian\fP, or \fBbicubic\fP\&. These are
listed in increasing order of smoothness/blurriness, with \fBbicubic\fP

Set filter parameters. Ignored if the filter is not tunable. Currently,
this affects the following filter parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B bcspline
Spline parameters (\fBB\fP and \fBC\fP). Defaults to 0.5 for both.
.TP
.B gaussian
Scale parameter (\fBt\fP). Increasing this makes the result blurrier.
Defaults to 1.
.TP
.B oversample
Minimum distance to an edge before interpolation is used. Setting this
to 0 will always interpolate edges, whereas setting it to 0.5 will
never interpolate, thus behaving as if the regular nearest neighbour
algorithm was used. Defaults to 0.0.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-blur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-scale\-wblur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-blur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-wblur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-blur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-wblur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-blur=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-wblur=<value>\fP
Kernel/window scaling factor (also known as a blur factor). Decreasing this
makes the result sharper, increasing it makes it blurrier (default 0). If
set to 0, the kernel\(aqs preferred blur factor is used. Note that setting
this too low (eg. 0.5) leads to bad results. It\(aqs generally recommended to
stick to values between 0.8 and 1.2.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-clamp=<0.0\-1.0>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-clamp\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-clamp\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-clamp\fP
Specifies a weight bias to multiply into negative coefficients. Specifying
\fB\-\-scale\-clamp=1\fP has the effect of removing negative weights completely,
thus effectively clamping the value range to [0\-1]. Values between 0.0 and
1.0 can be specified to apply only a moderate diminishment of negative
weights. This is especially useful for \fB\-\-tscale\fP, where it reduces
excessive ringing artifacts in the temporal domain (which typically
manifest themselves as short flashes or fringes of black, mostly around
moving edges) in exchange for potentially adding more blur. The default for
\fB\-\-tscale\-clamp\fP is 1.0, the others default to 0.0.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-cutoff=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-cutoff=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-cutoff=<value>\fP
Cut off the filter kernel prematurely once the value range drops below
this threshold. Doing so allows more aggressive pruning of skippable
coefficients by disregarding parts of the LUT which are effectively zeroed
out by the window function. Only affects polar (EWA) filters. The default
is 0.001 for each, which is perceptually transparent but provides a 10%\-20%
speedup, depending on the exact radius and filter kernel chosen.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-taper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-scale\-wtaper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-taper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-wtaper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-taper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-wtaper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-taper=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-wtaper=<value>\fP
Kernel/window taper factor. Increasing this flattens the filter function.
Value range is 0 to 1. A value of 0 (the default) means no flattening, a
value of 1 makes the filter completely flat (equivalent to a box function).
Values in between mean that some portion will be flat and the actual filter
function will be squeezed into the space in between.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-radius=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-radius=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-radius=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-radius=<value>\fP
Set radius for tunable filters, must be a float number between 0.5 and
16.0. Defaults to the filter\(aqs preferred radius if not specified. Doesn\(aqt
work for every scaler and VO combination.
.sp
Note that depending on filter implementation details and video scaling
ratio, the radius that actually being used might be different (most likely
being increased a bit).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-antiring=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-antiring=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-antiring=<value>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-antiring=<value>\fP
Set the antiringing strength. This tries to eliminate ringing, but can
introduce other artifacts in the process. Must be a float number between
0.0 and 1.0. The default value of 0.0 disables antiringing entirely.
.sp
Note that this doesn\(aqt affect the special filters \fBbilinear\fP and
\fBbicubic_fast\fP, nor does it affect any polar (EWA) scalers.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-window=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-window=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-dscale\-window=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-window=<window>\fP
(Advanced users only) Choose a custom windowing function for the kernel.
Defaults to the filter\(aqs preferred window if unset. Use
\fB\-\-scale\-window=help\fP to get a list of supported windowing functions.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scale\-wparam=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-wparam=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-cscale\-wparam=<window>\fP, \fB\-\-tscale\-wparam=<window>\fP
(Advanced users only) Configure the parameter for the window function given
by \fB\-\-scale\-window\fP etc. Ignored if the window is not tunable. Currently,
this affects the following window parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B kaiser
Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 6.33.
.TP
.B blackman
Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 0.16.
.TP
.B gaussian
Scale parameter (t). Increasing this makes the window wider. Defaults
to 1.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scaler\-lut\-size=<4..10>\fP
Set the size of the lookup texture for scaler kernels (default: 6). The
actual size of the texture is \fB2^N\fP for an option value of \fBN\fP\&. So the
lookup texture with the default setting uses 64 samples.
.sp
All weights are linearly interpolated from those samples, so increasing
the size of lookup table might improve the accuracy of scaler.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-scaler\-resizes\-only\fP
Disable the scaler if the video image is not resized. In that case,
\fBbilinear\fP is used instead of whatever is set with \fB\-\-scale\fP\&. Bilinear
will reproduce the source image perfectly if no scaling is performed.
Enabled by default. Note that this option never affects \fB\-\-cscale\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-linear\-scaling\fP
Scale in linear light. It should only be used with a
\fB\-\-fbo\-format\fP that has at least 16 bit precision. This option
has no effect on HDR content.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-correct\-downscaling\fP
When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size when
downscaling. Increases quality, but reduces performance while downscaling.
.sp
This will perform slightly sub\-optimally for anamorphic video (but still
better than without it) since it will extend the size to match only the
milder of the scale factors between the axes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-interpolation\fP
Reduce stuttering caused by mismatches in the video fps and display refresh
rate (also known as judder).
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

This was not required before mpv 0.14.0.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This essentially attempts to interpolate the missing frames by convoluting
the video along the temporal axis. The filter used can be controlled using
the \fB\-\-tscale\fP setting.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-interpolation\-threshold=<0..1,\-1>\fP
Threshold below which frame ratio interpolation gets disabled (default:
\fB0.0001\fP). This is calculated as \fBabs(disphz/vfps \- 1) < threshold\fP,
where \fBvfps\fP is the speed\-adjusted video FPS, and \fBdisphz\fP the
display refresh rate. (The speed\-adjusted video FPS is roughly equal to
the normal video FPS, but with slowdown and speedup applied. This matters
if you use \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-resample\fP to make video run synchronously
to the display FPS, or if you change the \fBspeed\fP property.)
.sp
The default is intended to almost always enable interpolation if the
playback rate is even slightly different from the display refresh rate. But
note that if you use e.g. \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-vdrop\fP, small deviations
in the rate can disable interpolation and introduce a discontinuity every
other minute.
.sp
Set this to \fB\-1\fP to disable this logic.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-pbo\fP
Enable use of PBOs. On some drivers this can be faster, especially if the
source video size is huge (e.g. so called "4K" video). On other drivers it
might be slower or cause latency issues.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dither\-depth=<N|no|auto>\fP
Set dither target depth to N. Default: no.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B no
Disable any dithering done by mpv.
.TP
.B auto
Automatic selection. If output bit depth cannot be detected, 8 bits per
component are assumed.
.TP
.B 8
Dither to 8 bit output.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the depth of the connected video display device cannot be
detected. Often, LCD panels will do dithering on their own, which conflicts
with this option and leads to ugly output.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dither\-size\-fruit=<2\-8>\fP
Set the size of the dither matrix (default: 6). The actual size of the
matrix is \fB(2^N) x (2^N)\fP for an option value of \fBN\fP, so a value of 6
gives a size of 64x64. The matrix is generated at startup time, and a large
matrix can take rather long to compute (seconds).
.sp
Used in \fB\-\-dither=fruit\fP mode only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dither=<fruit|ordered|no>\fP
Select dithering algorithm (default: fruit). (Normally, the
\fB\-\-dither\-depth\fP option controls whether dithering is enabled.)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-temporal\-dither\fP
Enable temporal dithering. (Only active if dithering is enabled in
general.) This changes between 8 different dithering patterns on each frame
by changing the orientation of the tiled dithering matrix. Unfortunately,
this can lead to flicker on LCD displays, since these have a high reaction
time.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-temporal\-dither\-period=<1\-128>\fP
Determines how often the dithering pattern is updated when
\fB\-\-temporal\-dither\fP is in use. 1 (the default) will update on every video
frame, 2 on every other frame, etc.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-debug\fP
Enables GPU debugging. What this means depends on the API type. For OpenGL,
it calls \fBglGetError()\fP, and requests a debug context. For Vulkan, it
enables validation layers.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-swapinterval=<n>\fP
Interval in displayed frames between two buffer swaps. 1 is equivalent to
enable VSYNC, 0 to disable VSYNC. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
.sp
Note that this depends on proper OpenGL vsync support. On some platforms
and drivers, this only works reliably when in fullscreen mode. It may also
require driver\-specific hacks if using multiple monitors, to ensure mpv
syncs to the right one. Compositing window managers can also lead to bad
results, as can missing or incorrect display FPS information (see
\fB\-\-display\-fps\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vulkan\-swap\-mode=<mode>\fP
Controls the presentation mode of the vulkan swapchain. This is similar
to the \fB\-\-opengl\-swapinterval\fP option.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B auto
Use the preferred swapchain mode for the vulkan context. (Default)
.TP
.B fifo
Non\-tearing, vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync on".
.TP
.B fifo\-relaxed
Tearing, vsync blocked. Late frames will tear instead of stuttering.
.TP
.B mailbox
Non\-tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "triple buffering".
.TP
.B immediate
Tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync off".
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vulkan\-queue\-count=<1..8>\fP
Controls the number of VkQueues used for rendering (limited by how many
your device supports). In theory, using more queues could enable some
parallelism between frames (when using a \fB\-\-swapchain\-depth\fP higher than
1), but it can also slow things down on hardware where there\(aqs no true
parallelism between queues. (Default: 1)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vulkan\-async\-transfer\fP
Enables the use of async transfer queues on supported vulkan devices. Using
them allows transfer operations like texture uploads and blits to happen
concurrently with the actual rendering, thus improving overall throughput
and power consumption. Enabled by default, and should be relatively safe.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vulkan\-async\-compute\fP
Enables the use of async compute queues on supported vulkan devices. Using
this, in theory, allows out\-of\-order scheduling of compute shaders with
graphics shaders, thus enabling the hardware to do more effective work while
waiting for pipeline bubbles and memory operations. Not beneficial on all
GPUs. It\(aqs worth noting that if async compute is enabled, and the device
supports more compute queues than graphics queues (bound by the restrictions
set by \fB\-\-vulkan\-queue\-count\fP), mpv will internally try and prefer the
use of compute shaders over fragment shaders wherever possible. Not enabled
by default, since it seems to cause issues with some drivers.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-d3d11\-warp=<yes|no|auto>\fP
Use WARP (Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform) with the D3D11 GPU
backend (default: auto). This is a high performance software renderer. By
default, it is only used when the system has no hardware adapters that
support D3D11. While the extended GPU features will work with WARP, they
can be very slow.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-d3d11\-feature\-level=<12_1|12_0|11_1|11_0|10_1|10_0|9_3|9_2|9_1>\fP
Select a specific feature level when using the D3D11 GPU backend. By
default, the highest available feature level is used. This option can be
used to select a lower feature level, which is mainly useful for debugging.
Most extended GPU features will not work at 9_x feature levels.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-d3d11\-flip=<yes|no>\fP
Enable flip\-model presentation, which avoids unnecessarily copying the
backbuffer by sharing surfaces with the DWM (default: yes). This may cause
performance issues with older drivers. If flip\-model presentation is not
supported (for example, on Windows 7 without the platform update), mpv will
automatically fall back to the older bitblt presentation model.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-d3d11\-sync\-interval=<0..4>\fP
Schedule each frame to be presented for this number of VBlank intervals.
(default: 1) Setting to 1 will enable VSync, setting to 0 will disable it.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-d3d11va\-zero\-copy=<yes|no>\fP
By default, when using hardware decoding with \fB\-\-gpu\-api=d3d11\fP, the
video image will be copied (GPU\-to\-GPU) from the decoder surface to a
shader resource. Set this option to avoid that copy by sampling directly
from the decoder image. This may increase performance and reduce power
usage, but can cause the image to be sampled incorrectly on the bottom and
right edges due to padding, and may invoke driver bugs, since Direct3D 11
technically does not allow sampling from a decoder surface (though most
drivers support it.)
.sp
Currently only relevant for \fB\-\-gpu\-api=d3d11\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-spirv\-compiler=<compiler>\fP
Controls which compiler is used to translate GLSL to SPIR\-V. This is
(currently) only relevant for \fB\-\-gpu\-api=vulkan\fP\&. The possible choices
are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B auto
Use the first available compiler. (Default)
.TP
.B shaderc
Use libshaderc, which is an API wrapper around glslang. This is
generally the most preferred, if available.
.TP
.B nvidia
Use nvidia\(aqs built\-in compiler. Only works for nvidia GPUs. Can be
buggy, but also supports some features glslang does not. Only works
with vulkan.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-glsl\-shaders=<file\-list>\fP
Custom GLSL hooks. These are a flexible way to add custom fragment shaders,

.B TEXTURE <name> (required)
The name of this texture. Hooks can then bind the texture under this
name using BIND. This must be the first option of the texture block.
.TP
.B SIZE <width> [<height>] [<depth>] (required)
The dimensions of the texture. The height and depth are optional. The
type of texture (1D, 2D or 3D) depends on the number of components
specified.
.TP
.B FORMAT <name> (required)
The texture format for the samples. Supported texture formats are listed
in debug logging when the \fBgpu\fP VO is initialized (look for
\fBTexture formats:\fP). Usually, this follows OpenGL naming conventions.
For example, \fBrgb16\fP provides 3 channels with normalized 16 bit
components. One oddity are float formats: for example, \fBrgba16f\fP has
16 bit internal precision, but the texture data is provided as 32 bit
floats, and the driver converts the data on texture upload.
.sp
Although format names follow a common naming convention, not all of them
are available on all hardware, drivers, GL versions, and so on.
.TP
.B FILTER <LINEAR|NEAREST>
The min/magnification filter used when sampling from this texture.
.TP
.B BORDER <CLAMP|REPEAT|MIRROR>
The border wrapping mode used when sampling from this texture.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Following the metadata is a string of bytes in hexadecimal notation that
define the raw texture data, corresponding to the format specified by
\fIFORMAT\fP, on a single line with no extra whitespace.
.sp
A \fBHOOK\fP block can set the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B HOOK <name> (required)
The texture which to hook into. May occur multiple times within a
metadata block, up to a predetermined limit. See below for a list of
hookable textures.
.TP
.B DESC <title>
User\-friendly description of the pass. This is the name used when
representing this shader in the list of passes for property
\fIvo\-passes\fP\&.
.TP
.B BIND <name>
Loads a texture (either coming from mpv or from a \fBTEXTURE\fP block)
and makes it available to the pass. When binding textures from mpv,
this will also set up macros to facilitate accessing it properly. See
below for a list. By default, no textures are bound. The special name
HOOKED can be used to refer to the texture that triggered this pass.
.TP
.B SAVE <name>
Gives the name of the texture to save the result of this pass into. By
default, this is set to the special name HOOKED which has the effect of
overwriting the hooked texture.
.TP
.B WIDTH <szexpr>, HEIGHT <szexpr>
Specifies the size of the resulting texture for this pass. \fBszexpr\fP
refers to an expression in RPN (reverse polish notation), using the
operators + \- * / > < !, floating point literals, and references to
sizes of existing texture (such as MAIN.width or CHROMA.height),
OUTPUT, or NATIVE_CROPPED (size of an input texture cropped after
pan\-and\-scan, video\-align\-x/y, video\-pan\-x/y, etc. and possibly
prescaled). By default, these are set to HOOKED.w and HOOKED.h,
espectively.
.TP
.B WHEN <szexpr>
Specifies a condition that needs to be true (non\-zero) for the shader
stage to be evaluated. If it fails, it will silently be omitted. (Note
that a shader stage like this which has a dependency on an optional
hook point can still cause that hook point to be saved, which has some
minor overhead)
.TP
.B OFFSET <ox> <oy>
Indicates a pixel shift (offset) introduced by this pass. These pixel
offsets will be accumulated and corrected during the next scaling pass
(\fBcscale\fP or \fBscale\fP). The default values are 0 0 which correspond
to no shift. Note that offsets are ignored when not overwriting the
hooked texture.
.TP
.B COMPONENTS <n>
Specifies how many components of this pass\(aqs output are relevant and
should be stored in the texture, up to 4 (rgba). By default, this value
is equal to the number of components in HOOKED.
.TP
.B COMPUTE <bw> <bh> [<tw> <th>]
Specifies that this shader should be treated as a compute shader, with
the block size bw and bh. The compute shader will be dispatched with
however many blocks are necessary to completely tile over the output.
Within each block, there will bw tw*th threads, forming a single work
group. In other words: tw and th specify the work group size, which can
be different from the block size. So for example, a compute shader with
bw, bh = 32 and tw, th = 8 running on a 500x500 texture would dispatch
16x16 blocks (rounded up), each with 8x8 threads.
.sp
Compute shaders in mpv are treated a bit different from fragment
shaders. Instead of defining a \fBvec4 hook\fP that produces an output
sample, you directly define \fBvoid hook\fP which writes to a fixed
writeonly image unit named \fBout_image\fP (this is bound by mpv) using
\fIimageStore\fP\&. To help translate texture coordinates in the absence of
vertices, mpv provides a special function \fBNAME_map(id)\fP to map from
the texel space of the output image to the texture coordinates for all
bound textures. In particular, \fBNAME_pos\fP is equivalent to
\fBNAME_map(gl_GlobalInvocationID)\fP, although using this only really
makes sense if (tw,th) == (bw,bh).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each bound mpv texture (via \fBBIND\fP) will make available the following
definitions to that shader pass, where NAME is the name of the bound
texture:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B vec4 NAME_tex(vec2 pos)
The sampling function to use to access the texture at a certain spot
(in texture coordinate space, range [0,1]). This takes care of any
necessary normalization conversions.
.TP
.B vec4 NAME_texOff(vec2 offset)
Sample the texture at a certain offset in pixels. This works like
NAME_tex but additionally takes care of necessary rotations, so that
sampling at e.g. vec2(\-1,0) is always one pixel to the left.
.TP
.B vec2 NAME_pos
The local texture coordinate of that texture, range [0,1].
.TP
.B vec2 NAME_size
The (rotated) size in pixels of the texture.
.TP
.B mat2 NAME_rot
The rotation matrix associated with this texture. (Rotates pixel space
to texture coordinates)
.TP
.B vec2 NAME_pt
The (unrotated) size of a single pixel, range [0,1].
.TP
.B float NAME_mul
The coefficient that needs to be multiplied into the texture contents
in order to normalize it to the range [0,1].
.TP
.B sampler NAME_raw
The raw bound texture itself. The use of this should be avoided unless
absolutely necessary.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Normally, users should use either NAME_tex or NAME_texOff to read from the
texture. For some shaders however , it can be better for performance to do
custom sampling from NAME_raw, in which case care needs to be taken to
respect NAME_mul and NAME_rot.
.sp
In addition to these parameters, the following uniforms are also globally
available:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B float random
A random number in the range [0\-1], different per frame.
.TP
.B int frame
A simple count of frames rendered, increases by one per frame and never
resets (regardless of seeks).
.TP
.B vec2 input_size
The size in pixels of the input image (possibly cropped and prescaled).
.TP
.B vec2 target_size
The size in pixels of the visible part of the scaled (and possibly
cropped) image.
.TP
.B vec2 tex_offset
Texture offset introduced by user shaders or options like panscan, video\-align\-x/y, video\-pan\-x/y.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Internally, vo_gpu may generate any number of the following textures.
Whenever a texture is rendered and saved by vo_gpu, all of the passes
that have hooked into it will run, in the order they were added by the
user. This is a list of the legal hook points:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B RGB, LUMA, CHROMA, ALPHA, XYZ (resizable)
Source planes (raw). Which of these fire depends on the image format of
the source.
.TP
.B CHROMA_SCALED, ALPHA_SCALED (fixed)
Source planes (upscaled). These only fire on subsampled content.
.TP
.B NATIVE (resizable)
The combined image, in the source colorspace, before conversion to RGB.
.TP
.B MAINPRESUB (resizable)
The image, after conversion to RGB, but before
\fB\-\-blend\-subtitles=video\fP is applied.
.TP
.B MAIN (resizable)
The main image, after conversion to RGB but before upscaling.
.TP
.B LINEAR (fixed)
Linear light image, before scaling. This only fires when
\fB\-\-linear\-scaling\fP is in effect.
.TP
.B SIGMOID (fixed)
Sigmoidized light, before scaling. This only fires when
\fB\-\-sigmoid\-upscaling\fP is in effect.
.TP
.B PREKERNEL (fixed)
The image immediately before the scaler kernel runs.
.TP
.B POSTKERNEL (fixed)
The image immediately after the scaler kernel runs.
.TP
.B SCALED (fixed)
The final upscaled image, before color management.
.TP
.B OUTPUT (fixed)
The final output image, after color management but before dithering and
drawing to screen.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Only the textures labelled with \fBresizable\fP may be transformed by the
pass. When overwriting a texture marked \fBfixed\fP, the WIDTH, HEIGHT and
OFFSET must be left at their default values.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-glsl\-shader=<file>\fP
CLI/config file only alias for \fB\-\-glsl\-shaders\-append\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-deband\fP
Enable the debanding algorithm. This greatly reduces the amount of visible
banding, blocking and other quantization artifacts, at the expense of
very slightly blurring some of the finest details. In practice, it\(aqs
virtually always an improvement \- the only reason to disable it would be
for performance.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-deband\-iterations=<1..16>\fP
The number of debanding steps to perform per sample. Each step reduces a
bit more banding, but takes time to compute. Note that the strength of each
step falls off very quickly, so high numbers (>4) are practically useless.
(Default 1)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-deband\-threshold=<0..4096>\fP
The debanding filter\(aqs cut\-off threshold. Higher numbers increase the
debanding strength dramatically but progressively diminish image details.
(Default 64)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-deband\-range=<1..64>\fP
The debanding filter\(aqs initial radius. The radius increases linearly for
each iteration. A higher radius will find more gradients, but a lower
radius will smooth more aggressively. (Default 16)
.sp
If you increase the \fB\-\-deband\-iterations\fP, you should probably decrease
this to compensate.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-deband\-grain=<0..4096>\fP
Add some extra noise to the image. This significantly helps cover up
remaining quantization artifacts. Higher numbers add more noise. (Default
48)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sigmoid\-upscaling\fP
When upscaling, use a sigmoidal color transform to avoid emphasizing
ringing artifacts. This also implies \fB\-\-linear\-scaling\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sigmoid\-center\fP
The center of the sigmoid curve used for \fB\-\-sigmoid\-upscaling\fP, must be a
float between 0.0 and 1.0. Defaults to 0.75 if not specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sigmoid\-slope\fP
The slope of the sigmoid curve used for \fB\-\-sigmoid\-upscaling\fP, must be a
float between 1.0 and 20.0. Defaults to 6.5 if not specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sharpen=<value>\fP
If set to a value other than 0, enable an unsharp masking filter. Positive
values will sharpen the image (but add more ringing and aliasing). Negative
values will blur the image. If your GPU is powerful enough, consider
alternatives like the \fBewa_lanczossharp\fP scale filter, or the
\fB\-\-scale\-blur\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-glfinish\fP
Call \fBglFinish()\fP before swapping buffers (default: disabled). Slower,
but might improve results when doing framedropping. Can completely ruin
performance. The details depend entirely on the OpenGL driver.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-waitvsync\fP
Call \fBglXWaitVideoSyncSGI\fP after each buffer swap (default: disabled).
This may or may not help with video timing accuracy and frame drop. It\(aqs
possible that this makes video output slower, or has no effect at all.
.sp
X11/GLX only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-dwmflush=<no|windowed|yes|auto>\fP
Calls \fBDwmFlush\fP after swapping buffers on Windows (default: auto). It
also sets \fBSwapInterval(0)\fP to ignore the OpenGL timing. Values are: no
(disabled), windowed (only in windowed mode), yes (also in full screen).
.sp
The value \fBauto\fP will try to determine whether the compositor is active,
and calls \fBDwmFlush\fP only if it seems to be.
.sp
This may help to get more consistent frame intervals, especially with
high\-fps clips \- which might also reduce dropped frames. Typically, a value
of \fBwindowed\fP should be enough, since full screen may bypass the DWM.
.sp
Windows only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-angle\-d3d11\-feature\-level=<11_0|10_1|10_0|9_3>\fP
Selects a specific feature level when using the ANGLE backend with D3D11.
By default, the highest available feature level is used. This option can be
used to select a lower feature level, which is mainly useful for debugging.
Note that OpenGL ES 3.0 is only supported at feature level 10_1 or higher.
Most extended OpenGL features will not work at lower feature levels
(similar to \fB\-\-gpu\-dumb\-mode\fP).
.sp
Windows with ANGLE only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-angle\-d3d11\-warp=<yes|no|auto>\fP
Use WARP (Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform) when using the ANGLE
backend with D3D11 (default: auto). This is a high performance software
renderer. By default, it is used when the Direct3D hardware does not
support Direct3D 11 feature level 9_3. While the extended OpenGL features
will work with WARP, they can be very slow.
.sp
Windows with ANGLE only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-angle\-egl\-windowing=<yes|no|auto>\fP
Use ANGLE\(aqs built in EGL windowing functions to create a swap chain
(default: auto). If this is set to \fBno\fP and the D3D11 renderer is in use,
ANGLE\(aqs built in swap chain will not be used and a custom swap chain that
is optimized for video rendering will be created instead. If set to
\fBauto\fP, a custom swap chain will be used for D3D11 and the built in swap
chain will be used for D3D9. This option is mainly for debugging purposes,
in case the custom swap chain has poor performance or does not work.
.sp
If set to \fByes\fP, the \fB\-\-angle\-max\-frame\-latency\fP,
\fB\-\-angle\-swapchain\-length\fP and \fB\-\-angle\-flip\fP options will have no
effect.
.sp
Windows with ANGLE only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-angle\-flip=<yes|no>\fP
Enable flip\-model presentation, which avoids unnecessarily copying the
backbuffer by sharing surfaces with the DWM (default: yes). This may cause
performance issues with older drivers. If flip\-model presentation is not
supported (for example, on Windows 7 without the platform update), mpv will
automatically fall back to the older bitblt presentation model.
.sp
If set to \fBno\fP, the \fB\-\-angle\-swapchain\-length\fP option will have no
effect.
.sp
Windows with ANGLE only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-angle\-renderer=<d3d9|d3d11|auto>\fP
Forces a specific renderer when using the ANGLE backend (default: auto). In
auto mode this will pick D3D11 for systems that support Direct3D 11 feature
level 9_3 or higher, and D3D9 otherwise. This option is mainly for
debugging purposes. Normally there is no reason to force a specific
renderer, though \fB\-\-angle\-renderer=d3d9\fP may give slightly better
performance on old hardware. Note that the D3D9 renderer only supports
OpenGL ES 2.0, so most extended OpenGL features will not work if this
renderer is selected (similar to \fB\-\-gpu\-dumb\-mode\fP).
.sp
Windows with ANGLE only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cocoa\-force\-dedicated\-gpu=<yes|no>\fP
Deactivates the automatic graphics switching and forces the dedicated GPU.
(default: no)
.sp
OS X only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cocoa\-cb\-sw\-renderer=<yes|no|auto>\fP
Use the Apple Software Renderer when using cocoa\-cb (default: auto). If set
to \fBno\fP the software renderer is never used and instead fails when a the
usual pixel format could not be created, \fByes\fP will always only use the
software renderer, and \fBauto\fP only falls back to the software renderer
when the usual pixel format couldn\(aqt be created.
.sp
OS X only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-macos\-title\-bar\-style=<dark|ultradark|light|mediumlight|auto>\fP
Sets the styling of the title bar (default: dark).
OS X and cocoa\-cb only
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B dark
Dark title bar with vibrancy, a subtle blurring effect that
dynamically blends the background (Video) into the title bar.
.TP
.B ultradark
Darker title bar with vibrancy (like QuickTime Player).
.TP
.B light
Bright title bar with vibrancy.
.TP
.B mediumlight
Less bright title bar with vibrancy.
.TP
.B auto
Detects the system settings and sets the title bar styling
appropriately, either ultradark or mediumlight.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-macos\-fs\-animation\-duration=<default|0\-1000>\fP
Sets the fullscreen resize animation duration in ms (default: default).
The default value is slightly less than the system\(aqs animation duration
(500ms) to prevent some problems when the end of an async animation happens
at the same time as the end of the system wide fullscreen animation. Setting
anything higher than 500ms will only prematurely cancel the resize animation
after the system wide animation ended. The upper limit is still set at
1000ms since it\(aqs possible that Apple or the user changes the system
defaults. Anything higher than 1000ms though seems too long and shouldn\(aqt be
set anyway.
OS X and cocoa\-cb only
.TP
.B \fB\-\-android\-surface\-size=<WxH>\fP
Set dimensions of the rendering surface used by the Android gpu context.
Needs to be set by the embedding application if the dimensions change during
runtime (i.e. if the device is rotated), via the surfaceChanged callback.
.sp
Android with \fB\-\-gpu\-context=android\fP only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-swapchain\-depth=<N>\fP
Allow up to N in\-flight frames. This essentially controls the frame
latency. Increasing the swapchain depth can improve pipelining and prevent
missed vsyncs, but increases visible latency. This option only mandates an
upper limit, the implementation can use a lower latency than requested
internally. A setting of 1 means that the VO will wait for every frame to
become visible before starting to render the next frame. (Default: 3)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-sw\fP
Continue even if a software renderer is detected.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-context=<sys>\fP
The value \fBauto\fP (the default) selects the GPU context. You can also pass
\fBhelp\fP to get a complete list of compiled in backends (sorted by
autoprobe order).

Restricts all OpenGL versions above a certain version. Versions are encoded
in hundreds, i.e. OpenGL 4.5 \-> 450. As an example, \-\-opengl\-restrict=300
would restrict OpenGL 3.0 and higher, effectively only allowing 2.x
contexts. Note that this only imposes a limit on context creation APIs, the
actual OpenGL context may still have a higher OpenGL version. (Default: 0)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-fbo\-format=<fmt>\fP
Selects the internal format of textures used for FBOs. The format can
influence performance and quality of the video output. \fBfmt\fP can be one
of: rgb8, rgb10, rgb10_a2, rgb16, rgb16f, rgb32f, rgba12, rgba16, rgba16f,

Finally, attempts to utilize rgb10_a2 or rgba8 if all of the previous formats
are not available.

.B \fB\-\-gamma\-factor=<0.1..2.0>\fP
Set an additional raw gamma factor (default: 1.0). If gamma is adjusted in

additional effect of parametrizing the inverse OOTF, in order to get
colorimetrically consistent results with the mastering display. For SDR, or
when using an ICC (profile (\fB\-\-icc\-profile\fP), setting this to a value
above 100 essentially causes the display to be treated as if it were an HDR
display in disguise. (See the note below)
.sp
By default, the chosen peak defaults to an appropriate value based on the
TRC in use. For SDR curves, it defaults to 100. For HDR curves, it
defaults to 100 * the transfer function\(aqs nominal peak.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
When using an SDR transfer function, this is normally not needed, and
setting it may lead to very unexpected results. The one time it \fIis\fP
useful is if you want to calibrate a HDR display using traditional
transfer functions and calibration equipment. In such cases, you can
set your HDR display to a high brightness such as 800 cd/m^2, and then
calibrate it to a standard curve like gamma2.8. Setting this value to
800 would then instruct mpv to essentially treat it as an HDR display
with the given peak. This may be a good alternative in environments
where PQ or HLG input to the display is not possible, and makes it
possible to use HDR displays with mpv regardless of operating system
support for HDMI HDR metadata.
.sp
In such a configuration, we highly recommend setting \fB\-\-tone\-mapping\fP
to \fBmobius\fP or even \fBclip\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tone\-mapping=<value>\fP
Specifies the algorithm used for tone\-mapping images onto the target
display. This is relevant for both HDR\->SDR conversion as well as gamut
reduction (e.g. playing back BT.2020 content on a standard gamut display).
Valid values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B clip
Hard\-clip any out\-of\-range values. Use this when you care about
perfect color accuracy for in\-range values at the cost of completely
distorting out\-of\-range values. Not generally recommended.
.TP
.B mobius
Generalization of Reinhard to a Möbius transform with linear section.
Smoothly maps out\-of\-range values while retaining contrast and colors
for in\-range material as much as possible. Use this when you care about
color accuracy more than detail preservation. This is somewhere in
between \fBclip\fP and \fBreinhard\fP, depending on the value of
\fB\-\-tone\-mapping\-param\fP\&.
.TP
.B reinhard
Reinhard tone mapping algorithm. Very simple continuous curve.
Preserves overall image brightness but uses nonlinear contrast, which
results in flattening of details and degradation in color accuracy.
.TP
.B hable
Similar to \fBreinhard\fP but preserves both dark and bright details
better (slightly sigmoidal), at the cost of slightly darkening /
desaturating everything. Developed by John Hable for use in video
games. Use this when you care about detail preservation more than
color/brightness accuracy. This is roughly equivalent to
\fB\-\-tone\-mapping=reinhard \-\-tone\-mapping\-param=0.24\fP\&. If possible,
you should also enable \fB\-\-hdr\-compute\-peak\fP for the best results.
(Default)
.TP
.B gamma
Fits a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.
.TP
.B linear
Linearly stretches the entire reference gamut to (a linear multiple of)
the display.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tone\-mapping\-param=<value>\fP
Set tone mapping parameters. Ignored if the tone mapping algorithm is not
tunable. This affects the following tone mapping algorithms:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B clip
Specifies an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal
before clipping. Defaults to 1.0.
.TP
.B mobius
Specifies the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every
value below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the
value, the more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing
bright details. Defaults to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope
still preserves in\-range colors fairly accurately.
.TP
.B reinhard
Specifies the local contrast coefficient at the display peak. Defaults
to 0.5, which means that in\-gamut values will be about half as bright
as when clipping.
.TP
.B gamma
Specifies the exponent of the function. Defaults to 1.8.
.TP
.B linear
Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching. Defaults to 1.0.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hdr\-compute\-peak=<auto|yes|no>\fP
Compute the HDR peak and frame average brightness per\-frame instead of
relying on tagged metadata. These values are averaged over local regions as
well as over several frames to prevent the value from jittering around too
much. This option basically gives you dynamic, per\-scene tone mapping.
Requires compute shaders, which is a fairly recent OpenGL feature, and will
probably also perform horribly on some drivers, so enable at your own risk.
The special value \fBauto\fP (default) will enable HDR peak computation
automatically if compute shaders and SSBOs are supported.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tone\-mapping\-desaturate=<value>\fP
Apply desaturation for highlights. The parameter essentially controls the
steepness of the desaturation curve. The higher the parameter, the more
aggressively colors will be desaturated. This setting helps prevent
unnaturally blown\-out colors for super\-highlights, by (smoothly) turning
into white instead. This makes images feel more natural, at the cost of
reducing information about out\-of\-range colors.
.sp
The default of 0.5 provides a good balance. This value is weaker than the
ACES ODT curves\(aq recommendation, but works better for most content in
practice. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gamut\-warning\fP
If enabled, mpv will mark all clipped/out\-of\-gamut pixels that exceed a
given threshold (currently hard\-coded to 101%). The affected pixels will be
inverted to make them stand out. Note: This option applies after the
effects of all of mpv\(aqs color space transformation / tone mapping options,
so it\(aqs a good idea to combine this with \fB\-\-tone\-mapping=clip\fP and use
\fB\-\-target\-prim\fP to set the gamut to simulate. For example,
\fB\-\-target\-prim=bt.709\fP would make mpv highlight all pixels that exceed the
gamut of a standard gamut (sRGB) display. This option also does not work
well with ICC profiles, since the 3DLUTs are always generated against the
source color space and have chromatically\-accurate clipping built in.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-use\-embedded\-icc\-profile\fP
Load the embedded ICC profile contained in media files such as PNG images.
(Default: yes). Note that this option only works when also using a display
ICC profile (\fB\-\-icc\-profile\fP or \fB\-\-icc\-profile\-auto\fP), and also
requires LittleCMS 2 support.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-icc\-profile=<file>\fP
Load an ICC profile and use it to transform video RGB to screen output.
Needs LittleCMS 2 support compiled in. This option overrides the
\fB\-\-target\-prim\fP, \fB\-\-target\-trc\fP and \fB\-\-icc\-profile\-auto\fP options.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-icc\-profile\-auto\fP
Automatically select the ICC display profile currently specified by the
display settings of the operating system.
.sp
NOTE: On Windows, the default profile must be an ICC profile. WCS profiles
are not supported.
.sp
Applications using libmpv with the render API need to provide the ICC
profile via \fBMPV_RENDER_PARAM_ICC_PROFILE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-icc\-cache\-dir=<dirname>\fP
Store and load the 3D LUTs created from the ICC profile in this directory.
This can be used to speed up loading, since LittleCMS 2 can take a while to
create a 3D LUT. Note that these files contain uncompressed LUTs. Their
size depends on the \fB\-\-icc\-3dlut\-size\fP, and can be very big.
.sp
NOTE: This is not cleaned automatically, so old, unused cache files may
stick around indefinitely.
.TP

\fB\-\-icc\-profile\fP).

Default is 64x64x64. Sizes may range from 2 to 512.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-icc\-contrast=<0\-1000000>\fP
Specifies an upper limit on the target device\(aqs contrast ratio. This is
detected automatically from the profile if possible, but for some profiles
it might be missing, causing the contrast to be assumed as infinite. As a
result, video may appear darker than intended. This only affects BT.1886
content. The default of 0 means no limit.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-blend\-subtitles=<yes|video|no>\fP
Blend subtitles directly onto upscaled video frames, before interpolation
and/or color management (default: no). Enabling this causes subtitles to be
affected by \fB\-\-icc\-profile\fP, \fB\-\-target\-prim\fP, \fB\-\-target\-trc\fP,
\fB\-\-interpolation\fP, \fB\-\-gamma\-factor\fP and \fB\-\-glsl\-shaders\fP\&. It also
increases subtitle performance when using \fB\-\-interpolation\fP\&.
.sp
The downside of enabling this is that it restricts subtitles to the visible
portion of the video, so you can\(aqt have subtitles exist in the black
margins below a video (for example).
.sp
If \fBvideo\fP is selected, the behavior is similar to \fByes\fP, but subs are
drawn at the video\(aqs native resolution, and scaled along with the video.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This changes the way subtitle colors are handled. Normally,
subtitle colors are assumed to be in sRGB and color managed as
such. Enabling this makes them treated as being in the video\(aqs
color space instead. This is good if you want things like
softsubbed ASS signs to match the video colors, but may cause
SRT subtitles or similar to look slightly off.

Blend the frame against a 16x16 gray/white tiles background (default).
.TP
.B blend
Blend the frame against the background color (\fB\-\-background\fP, normally
black).
.TP
.B yes
Try to create a framebuffer with alpha component. This only makes sense
if the video contains alpha information (which is extremely rare). May
not be supported on all platforms. If alpha framebuffers are
unavailable, it silently falls back on a normal framebuffer. Note that
if you set the \fB\-\-fbo\-format\fP option to a non\-default value, a
format with alpha must be specified, or this won\(aqt work.
This does not work on X11 with EGL and Mesa (freedesktop bug 67676).
.TP
.B no
Ignore alpha component.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-rectangle\-textures\fP
Force use of rectangle textures (default: no). Normally this shouldn\(aqt have
any advantages over normal textures. Note that hardware decoding overrides
this flag. Could be removed any time.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-background=<color>\fP
Color used to draw parts of the mpv window not covered by video. See
\fB\-\-osd\-color\fP option how colors are defined.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-tex\-pad\-x\fP, \fB\-\-gpu\-tex\-pad\-y\fP
Enlarge the video source textures by this many pixels. For debugging only
(normally textures are sized exactly, but due to hardware decoding interop
we may have to deal with additional padding, which can be tested with these
options). Could be removed any time.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-opengl\-early\-flush=<yes|no|auto>\fP
Call \fBglFlush()\fP after rendering a frame and before attempting to display
it (default: auto). Can fix stuttering in some cases, in other cases
probably causes it. The \fBauto\fP mode will call \fBglFlush()\fP only if
the renderer is going to wait for a while after rendering, instead of
flipping GL front and backbuffers immediately (i.e. it doesn\(aqt call it
in display\-sync mode).
.sp
On OSX this is always deactivated because it only causes performance
problems and other regressions.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-dumb\-mode=<yes|no|auto>\fP
This mode is extremely restricted, and will disable most extended
features. That includes high quality scalers and custom shaders!
.sp
It is intended for hardware that does not support FBOs (including GLES,
which supports it insufficiently), or to get some more performance out of
bad or old hardware.
.sp
This mode is forced automatically if needed, and this option is mostly
useful for debugging. The default of \fBauto\fP will enable it automatically
if nothing uses features which require FBOs.
.sp
This option might be silently removed in the future.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gpu\-shader\-cache\-dir=<dirname>\fP
Store and load compiled GLSL shaders in this directory. Normally, shader
compilation is very fast, so this is usually not needed. It mostly matters
for GPU APIs that require internally recompiling shaders to other languages,
for example anything based on ANGLE or Vulkan. Enabling this can improve
startup performance on these platforms.

stick around indefinitely.

.B \fB\-\-display\-tags=tag1,tags2,...\fP
Set the list of tags that should be displayed on the terminal. Tags that
are in the list, but are not present in the played file, will not be shown.
If a value ends with \fB*\fP, all tags are matched by prefix (though there
is no general globbing). Just passing \fB*\fP essentially filtering.
.sp
The default includes a common list of tags, call mpv with \fB\-\-list\-options\fP
to see it.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-mc=<seconds/frame>\fP
Maximum A\-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-autosync=<factor>\fP
Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \fB\-\-autosync=0\fP, the default, will cause frame timing to be
based entirely on audio delay measurements. Specifying \fB\-\-autosync=1\fP
will do the same, but will subtly change the A/V correction algorithm. An
uneven video framerate in a video which plays fine with \fB\-\-no\-audio\fP can
often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than 1. The
higher the value, the closer the timing will be to \fB\-\-no\-audio\fP\&. Try
\fB\-\-autosync=30\fP to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not
implement a perfect audio delay measurement. With this value, if large A/V
sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds to settle
out. This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets should be the only
side effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-video\-timing\-offset=<seconds>\fP
Control how long before video display target time the frame should be
rendered (default: 0.050). If a video frame should be displayed at a
certain time, the VO will start rendering the frame earlier, and then will
perform a blocking wait until the display time, and only then "swap" the
frame to display. The rendering cannot start before the previous frame is
displayed, so this value is implicitly limited by the video framerate. With
normal video frame rates, the default value will ensure that rendering is
always immediately started after the previous frame was displayed. On the
other hand, setting a too high value can reduce responsiveness with low
FPS value.
.sp
For client API users using the render API (or the deprecated \fBopengl\-cb\fP
API), this option is interesting, because you can stop the render API
from limiting your FPS (see \fBmpv_render_context_render()\fP documentation).
.sp
This applies only to audio timing modes (e.g. \fB\-\-video\-sync=audio\fP). In
other modes (\fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-...\fP), video timing relies on vsync
blocking, and this option is not used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-video\-sync=<audio|...>\fP
How the player synchronizes audio and video.
.sp
If you use this option, you usually want to set it to \fBdisplay\-resample\fP
to enable a timing mode that tries to not skip or repeat frames when for
example playing 24fps video on a 24Hz screen.
.sp
The modes starting with \fBdisplay\-\fP try to output video frames completely
synchronously to the display, using the detected display vertical refresh
rate as a hint how fast frames will be displayed on average. These modes
change video speed slightly to match the display. See \fB\-\-video\-sync\-...\fP
options for fine tuning. The robustness of this mode is further reduced by
making a some idealized assumptions, which may not always apply in reality.
Behavior can depend on the VO and the system\(aqs video and audio drivers.
Media files must use constant framerate. Section\-wise VFR might work as well
with some container formats (but not e.g. mkv). If the sync code detects
severe A/V desync, or the framerate cannot be detected, the player
automatically reverts to \fBaudio\fP mode for some time or permanently. These
modes also require a vsync blocked presentation mode. For OpenGL, this
translates to \fB\-\-opengl\-swapinterval=1\fP\&. For Vulkan, it translates to
\fB\-\-vulkan\-swap\-mode=fifo\fP (or \fBfifo\-relaxed\fP).
.sp
The modes with \fBdesync\fP in their names do not attempt to keep audio/video
in sync. They will slowly (or quickly) desync, until e.g. the next seek
happens. These modes are meant for testing, not serious use.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B audio
Time video frames to audio. This is the most robust
mode, because the player doesn\(aqt have to assume anything
about how the display behaves. The disadvantage is that
it can lead to occasional frame drops or repeats. If
audio is disabled, this uses the system clock. This is
the default mode.
.TP
.B display\-resample
Resample audio to match the video. This mode will also
try to adjust audio speed to compensate for other drift.
(This means it will play the audio at a different speed
every once in a while to reduce the A/V difference.)
.TP
.B display\-resample\-vdrop
Resample audio to match the video. Drop video
frames to compensate for drift.
.TP
.B display\-resample\-desync
Like the previous mode, but no A/V compensation.
.TP
.B display\-vdrop
Drop or repeat video frames to compensate desyncing
video. (Although it should have the same effects as
\fBaudio\fP, the implementation is very different.)
.TP
.B display\-adrop
Drop or repeat audio data to compensate desyncing
video. See \fB\-\-video\-sync\-adrop\-size\fP\&. This mode will
cause severe audio artifacts if the real monitor
refresh rate is too different from the reported or
forced rate.
.TP
.B display\-desync
Sync video to display, and let audio play on its own.

.B desync
Sync video according to system clock, and let audio play

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-video\-sync\-max\-video\-change=<value>\fP
Maximum speed difference in percent that is applied to video with
\fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-...\fP (default: 1). Display sync mode will be
disabled if the monitor and video refresh way do not match within the
given range. It tries multiples as well: playing 30 fps video on a 60 Hz
screen will duplicate every second frame. Playing 24 fps video on a 60 Hz
screen will play video in a 2\-3\-2\-3\-... pattern.
.sp
The default settings are not loose enough to speed up 23.976 fps video to
25 fps. We consider the pitch change too extreme to allow this behavior
by default. Set this option to a value of \fB5\fP to enable it.
.sp
Note that in the \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-resample\fP mode, audio speed will
additionally be changed by a small amount if necessary for A/V sync. See
\fB\-\-video\-sync\-max\-audio\-change\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-video\-sync\-max\-audio\-change=<value>\fP
Maximum \fIadditional\fP speed difference in percent that is applied to audio
with \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-...\fP (default: 0.125). Normally, the player
plays the audio at the speed of the video. But if the difference between
audio and video position is too high, e.g. due to drift or other timing
errors, it will attempt to speed up or slow down audio by this additional
factor. Too low values could lead to video frame dropping or repeating if
the A/V desync cannot be compensated, too high values could lead to chaotic
frame dropping due to the audio "overshooting" and skipping multiple video
frames before the sync logic can react.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-video\-sync\-adrop\-size=<value>\fP
For the \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\-adrop\fP mode. This mode duplicates/drops
audio data to keep audio in sync with video. To avoid audio artifacts on
jitter (which would add/remove samples all the time), this is done in
relatively large, fixed units, controlled by this option. The unit is
seconds.

.B \fB\-\-external\-files=<file\-list>\fP
Load a file and add all of its tracks. This is useful to play different

for advanced \fB\-\-lavfi\-complex\fP used (like playing two video files at
the same time).
.sp
Unlike \fB\-\-sub\-files\fP and \fB\-\-audio\-files\fP, this includes all tracks, and
does not cause default stream selection over the "proper" file. This makes
it slightly less intrusive. (In mpv 0.28.0 and before, this was not quite

This does not affect playlist expansion, redirection, or other loading of
referenced files like with ordered chapters.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-record\-file=<file>\fP
Record the current stream to the given target file. The target file will
always be overwritten without asking.
.sp
This remuxes the source stream without reencoding, which makes this a
highly fragile and experimental feature. It\(aqs entirely possible that this
writes files which are broken, not standards compliant, not playable with
all players (including mpv), or incomplete.
.sp
The target file format is determined by the file extension of the target
filename. It is recommended to use the same target container as the source
container if possible, and preferring Matroska as fallback.
.sp
Seeking during stream recording, or enabling/disabling stream recording
during playback, can cut off data, or produce "holes" in the output file.
These are technical restrictions. In particular, video data or subtitles
which were read ahead can produce such holes, which might cause playback
problems with various players (including mpv).

The behavior of this option might changed in the future, such as changing
it to a template (similar to \fB\-\-screenshot\-template\fP), being renamed,
removed, or anything else, until it is declared semi\-stable.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-lavfi\-complex=<string>\fP
Set a "complex" libavfilter filter, which means a single filter graph can
take input from multiple source audio and video tracks. The graph can result
in a single audio or video output (or both).
.sp
Currently, the filter graph labels are used to select the participating
input tracks and audio/video output. The following rules apply:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
A label of the form \fBaidN\fP selects audio track N as input (e.g.
\fBaid1\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A label of the form \fBvidN\fP selects video track N as input.
.IP \(bu 2
A label named \fBao\fP will be connected to the audio output.
.IP \(bu 2
A label named \fBvo\fP will be connected to the video output.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each label can be used only once. If you want to use e.g. an audio stream
for multiple filters, you need to use the \fBasplit\fP filter. Multiple
video or audio outputs are not possible, but you can use filters to merge
them into one.
.sp
It\(aqs not possible to change the tracks connected to the filter at runtime,
unless you explicitly change the \fBlavfi\-complex\fP property and set new
track assignments. When the graph is changed, the track selection is changed
according to the used labels as well.
.sp
Other tracks, as long as they\(aqre not connected to the filter, and the
corresponding output is not connected to the filter, can still be freely
changed with the normal methods.
.sp
Note that the normal filter chains (\fB\-\-af\fP, \fB\-\-vf\fP) are applied between
the complex graphs (e.g. \fBao\fP label) and the actual output.

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
To get multichannel/surround audio, use \fB\-\-audio\-channels=auto\fP\&. The
default for this option is \fBauto\-safe\fP, which makes this audio output
explicitly reject multichannel output, as there is no way to detect
whether a certain channel layout is actually supported.

JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) audio output driver.
.sp
The following global options are supported by this audio output:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jack\-port=<name>\fP
Connects to the ports with the given name (default: physical ports).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jack\-name=<client>\fP
Client name that is passed to JACK (default: \fBmpv\fP). Useful
if you want to have certain connections established automatically.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jack\-autostart=<yes|no>\fP
Automatically start jackd if necessary (default: disabled). Note that
this tends to be unreliable and will flood stdout with server messages.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jack\-connect=<yes|no>\fP
Automatically create connections to output ports (default: enabled).
When enabled, the maximum number of output channels will be limited to
the number of available output ports.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-jack\-std\-channel\-layout=<waveext|any>\fP
Select the standard channel layout (default: waveext). JACK itself has no
notion of channel layouts (i.e. assigning which speaker a given
channel is supposed to map to) \- it just takes whatever the application
outputs, and reroutes it to whatever the user defines. This means the
user and the application are in charge of dealing with the channel
layout. \fBwaveext\fP uses WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE order, which, even
though it was defined by Microsoft, is the standard on many systems.
The value \fBany\fP makes JACK accept whatever comes from the audio
filter chain, regardless of channel layout and without reordering. This
mode is probably not very useful, other than for debugging or when used
with fixed setups.

.sp
The following global options are supported by this audio output:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-coreaudio\-change\-physical\-format=<yes|no>\fP
Change the physical format to one similar to the requested audio format
(default: no). This has the advantage that multichannel audio output
will actually work. The disadvantage is that it will change the
system\-wide audio settings. This is equivalent to changing the \fBFormat\fP
setting in the \fBAudio Devices\fP dialog in the \fBAudio MIDI Setup\fP
utility. Note that this does not affect the selected speaker setup.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-coreaudio\-spdif\-hack=<yes|no>\fP
Try to pass through AC3/DTS data as PCM. This is useful for drivers
which do not report AC3 support. It converts the AC3 data to float,
and assumes the driver will do the inverse conversion, which means
a typical A/V receiver will pick it up as compressed IEC framed AC3
stream, ignoring that it\(aqs marked as PCM. This disables normal AC3
passthrough (even if the device reports it as supported). Use with
extreme care.

OpenAL audio output driver
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-openal\-num\-buffers=<2\-128>\fP
Specify the number of audio buffers to use. Lower values are better for
lower CPU usage. Default: 4.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-openal\-num\-samples=<256\-32768>\fP
Specify the number of complete samples to use for each buffer. Higher

.B \fBpulse\fP
PulseAudio audio output driver
.sp
The following global options are supported by this audio output:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-pulse\-host=<host>\fP
Specify the host to use. An empty <host> string uses a local connection,
"localhost" uses network transfer (most likely not what you want).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-pulse\-buffer=<1\-2000|native>\fP
Set the audio buffer size in milliseconds. A higher value buffers
more data, and has a lower probability of buffer underruns. A smaller
value makes the audio stream react faster, e.g. to playback speed
changes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-pulse\-latency\-hacks=<yes|no>\fP
Enable hacks to workaround PulseAudio timing bugs (default: no). If
enabled, mpv will do elaborate latency calculations on its own. If
disabled, it will use PulseAudio automatically updated timing
information. Disabling this might help with e.g. networked audio or
some plugins, while enabling it might help in some unknown situations

Override autodetected display refresh rate value (the value is needed
for framedrop to allow video playback rates higher than display
refresh rate, and for vsync\-aware frame timing adjustments). Default 0
means use autodetected value. A positive value is interpreted as a
refresh rate in Hz and overrides the autodetected value. A negative
value disables all timing adjustment and framedrop logic.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-composite\-detect\fP
NVIDIA\(aqs current VDPAU implementation behaves somewhat differently
under a compositing window manager and does not give accurate frame
timing information. With this option enabled, the player tries to
detect whether a compositing window manager is active. If one is
detected, the player disables timing adjustments as if the user had
specified \fBfps=\-1\fP (as they would be based on incorrect input). This
means timing is somewhat less accurate than without compositing, but
with the composited mode behavior of the NVIDIA driver, there is no
hard playback speed limit even without the disabled logic. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-composite\-detect=no\fP to disable.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-queuetime\-windowed=<number>\fP and \fBqueuetime\-fs=<number>\fP
Use VDPAU\(aqs presentation queue functionality to queue future video
frame changes at most this many milliseconds in advance (default: 50).
See below for additional information.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-output\-surfaces=<2\-15>\fP
Allocate this many output surfaces to display video frames (default:
3). See below for additional information.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-colorkey=<#RRGGBB|#AARRGGBB>\fP
Set the VDPAU presentation queue background color, which in practice
is the colorkey used if VDPAU operates in overlay mode (default:
\fB#020507\fP, some shade of black). If the alpha component of this value
is 0, the default VDPAU colorkey will be used instead (which is usually
green).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vo\-vdpau\-force\-yuv\fP
Never accept RGBA input. This means mpv will insert a filter to convert
to a YUV format before the VO. Sometimes useful to force availability
of certain YUV\-only features, like video equalizer or deinterlacing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using the VDPAU frame queuing functionality controlled by the queuetime
options makes mpv\(aqs frame flip timing less sensitive to system CPU load and
allows mpv to start decoding the next frame(s) slightly earlier, which can
reduce jitter caused by individual slow\-to\-decode frames. However, the
NVIDIA graphics drivers can make other window behavior such as window moves
choppy if VDPAU is using the blit queue (mainly happens if you have the
composite extension enabled) and this feature is active. If this happens on
your system and it bothers you then you can set the queuetime value to 0 to
disable this feature. The settings to use in windowed and fullscreen mode
are separate because there should be no reason to disable this for
fullscreen mode (as the driver issue should not affect the video itself).
.sp
You can queue more frames ahead by increasing the queuetime values and the
\fBoutput_surfaces\fP count (to ensure enough surfaces to buffer video for a
certain time ahead you need at least as many surfaces as the video has
frames during that time, plus two). This could help make video smoother in
some cases. The main downsides are increased video RAM requirements for
the surfaces and laggier display response to user commands (display
changes only become visible some time after they\(aqre queued). The graphics
driver implementation may also have limits on the length of maximum
queuing time or number of queued surfaces that work well or at all.

This option doesn\(aqt apply if libva supports video post processing (vpp).
In this case, the default for \fBdeint\-mode\fP is \fBno\fP, and enabling

.TP
.B \fB\-\-rpi\-display=<number>\fP

.B \fB\-\-rpi\-background=<yes|no>\fP
Whether to render a black background behind the video (default: no).
Normally it\(aqs better to kill the console framebuffer instead, which

.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-connector=[<gpu_number>.]<name>\fP
Select the connector to use (usually this is a monitor.) If \fB<name>\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-mode=<number>\fP
Mode ID to use (resolution and frame rate).
(default: 0)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-osd\-plane\-id=<number>\fP
Select the DRM plane index to use for OSD (or OSD and video).
Index is zero based, and related to crtc.
When using this option with the drm_prime renderer, it will only affect
the OSD contents. Otherwise it will set OSD & video plane.
(default: primary plane)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-video\-plane\-id=<number>\fP
Select the DRM plane index to use for video layer.
Index is zero based, and related to crtc.
This option only has effect when using the drm_prime renderer (which
supports several layers) together with \fBvo=gpu\fP and \fBgpu\-context=drm\fP\&.
(default: first overlay plane)
.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-format=<xrgb8888|xrgb2101010>\fP
Select the DRM format to use (default: xrgb8888). This allows you to
choose the bit depth of the DRM mode. xrgb8888 is your usual 24 bit per
pixel/8 bits per channel packed RGB format with 8 bits of padding.
xrgb2101010 is a packed 30 bits per pixel/10 bits per channel packed RGB
format with 2 bits of padding.
.sp
Unless you have an intel graphics card, a recent kernel and a recent
version of mesa (>=18) xrgb2101010 is unlikely to work for you.
.sp
This currently only has an effect when used together with the \fBdrm\fP
backend for the \fBgpu\fP VO. The \fBdrm\fP VO always uses xrgb8888.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-drm\-osd\-size=<[WxH]>\fP
Sets the OSD OpenGL size to the specified size. OSD will then be upscaled
to the current screen resolution. This option can be useful when using
several layers in high resolutions with a GPU which cannot handle it.
Note : this option is only available with DRM atomic support.
(default: display resolution)

encoder, and using another codec will fail horribly.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBformat=format:srate:channels:out\-srate:out\-channels\fP
Does not do any format conversion itself. Rather, it may cause the
filter system to insert necessary conversion filters before or after this
filter if needed. It is primarily useful for controlling the audio format
going into other filters. To specify the format for audio output, see
\fB\-\-audio\-format\fP, \fB\-\-audio\-samplerate\fP, and \fB\-\-audio\-channels\fP\&. This
filter is able to force a particular format, whereas \fB\-\-audio\-*\fP
may be overridden by the ao based on output compatibility.
.sp
All parameters are optional. The first 3 parameters restrict what the filter
accepts as input. They will therefore cause conversion filters to be
inserted before this one.  The \fBout\-\fP parameters tell the filters or audio
outputs following this filter how to interpret the data without actually
doing a conversion. Setting these will probably just break things unless you

Scales audio tempo without altering pitch, optionally synced to playback
speed (default).
.sp
This works by playing \(aqstride\(aq ms of audio at normal speed then consuming
\(aqstride*scale\(aq ms of input audio. It pieces the strides together by
blending \(aqoverlap\(aq% of stride with audio following the previous stride. It
optionally performs a short statistical analysis on the next \(aqsearch\(aq ms

.TP
.B \fBstride=<amount>\fP
Length in milliseconds to output each stride. Too high of a value will
cause noticeable skips at high scale amounts and an echo at low scale
amounts. Very low values will alter pitch. Increasing improves

.TP
.B \fBoverlap=<percent>\fP
Percentage of stride to overlap. Decreasing improves performance.

Determine PTS based on sample count (default: no). If this is enabled,

Instead, it pass a sample count as PTS to libavfilter, and compute the
PTS used by mpv based on that and the input PTS. This helps with filters
which output a recomputed PTS instead of the original PTS (including
filters which require the PTS to start at 0). mpv normally expects
filters to not touch the PTS (or only to the extent of changing frame
boundaries), so this is not the default, but it will be needed to use
broken filters. In practice, these broken filters will either cause slow
A/V desync over time (with some files), or break playback completely if

Most builtin filters are deprecated in some ways, unless they\(aqre only available
in mpv (such as filters which deal with mpv specifics, or which are
implemented in mpv only).
.sp
If a filter is not builtin, the \fBlavfi\-bridge\fP will be automatically
tried. This bridge does not support help output, and does not verify
parameters before the filter is actually used. Although the mpv syntax
is rather similar to libavfilter\(aqs, it\(aqs not the same. (Which means not
everything accepted by vf_lavfi\(aqs \fBgraph\fP option will be accepted by
\fB\-\-vf\fP\&.)
.sp
You can also prefix the filter name with \fBlavfi\-\fP to force the wrapper.
This is helpful if the filter name collides with a deprecated mpv builtin
filter. For example \fB\-\-vf=lavfi\-scale=args\fP would use libavfilter\(aqs
\fBscale\fP filter over mpv\(aqs deprecated builtin one.

Format name, e.g. rgb15, bgr24, 420p, etc. (default: don\(aqt change).
.TP
.B \fB<colormatrix>\fP
Controls the YUV to RGB color space conversion when playing video. There
are various standards. Normally, BT.601 should be used for SD video, and
BT.709 for HD video. (This is done by default.) Using incorrect color space
results in slightly under or over saturated and shifted colors.
.sp
These options are not always supported. Different video outputs provide
varying degrees of support. The \fBgpu\fP and \fBvdpau\fP video output
drivers usually offer full support. The \fBxv\fP output can set the color
space if the system video driver supports it, but not input and output
levels. The \fBscale\fP video filter can configure color space and input
levels, but only if the output format is RGB (if the video output driver
supports RGB output, you can force this with \fB\-vf scale,format=rgba\fP).
.sp
If this option is set to \fBauto\fP (which is the default), the video\(aqs
color space flag will be used. If that flag is unset, the color space
will be selected automatically. This is done using a simple heuristic that
attempts to distinguish SD and HD video. If the video is larger than
1279x576 pixels, BT.709 (HD) will be used; otherwise BT.601 (SD) is
selected.

.TP
.B \fBvapoursynth=file:buffered\-frames:concurrent\-frames\fP
Loads a VapourSynth filter script. This is intended for streamed
processing: mpv actually provides a source filter, instead of using a
native VapourSynth video source. The mpv source will answer frame
requests only within a small window of frames (the size of this window
is controlled with the \fBbuffered\-frames\fP parameter), and requests outside
of that will return errors. As such, you can\(aqt use the full power of
VapourSynth, but you can use certain filters.
.sp
If you just want to play video generated by a VapourSynth (i.e. using
a native VapourSynth video source), it\(aqs better to use \fBvspipe\fP and a
FIFO to feed the video to mpv. The same applies if the filter script
requires random frame access (see \fBbuffered\-frames\fP parameter).
.sp
This filter is experimental. If it turns out that it works well and is
used, it will be ported to libavfilter. Otherwise, it will be just removed.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBfile\fP
Filename of the script source. Currently, this is always a python
script. The variable \fBvideo_in\fP is set to the mpv video source,
and it is expected that the script reads video from it. (Otherwise,
mpv will decode no video, and the video packet queue will overflow,
eventually leading to audio being stopped.) The script is also
expected to pass through timestamps using the \fB_DurationNum\fP and
\fB_DurationDen\fP frame properties.

.TP
.B \fBbuffered\-frames\fP
Maximum number of decoded video frames that should be buffered before
the filter (default: 4). This specifies the maximum number of frames
the script can request in reverse direction.
E.g. if \fBbuffered\-frames=5\fP, and the script just requested frame 15,
it can still request frame 10, but frame 9 is not available anymore.
If it requests frame 30, mpv will decode 15 more frames, and keep only
frames 25\-30.
.sp
The actual number of buffered frames also depends on the value of the
\fBconcurrent\-frames\fP option. Currently, both option values are
multiplied to get the final buffer size.
.sp
(Normally, VapourSynth source filters must provide random access, but
mpv was made for playback, and does not provide frame\-exact random
access. The way this video filter works is a compromise to make simple
filters work anyway.)
.TP
.B \fBconcurrent\-frames\fP
Number of frames that should be requested in parallel. The
level of concurrency depends on the filter and how quickly mpv can
decode video to feed the filter. This value should probably be
proportional to the number of cores on your machine. Most time,
making it higher than the number of cores can actually make it
slower.
.sp
By default, this uses the special value \fBauto\fP, which sets the option
to the number of detected logical CPU cores.
.UNINDENT

The following variables are defined by mpv:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBvideo_in\fP
The mpv video source as vapoursynth clip. Note that this has no length
set, which confuses many filters. Using \fBTrim\fP on the clip with a
high dummy length can turn it into a finite clip.
.TP
.B \fBvideo_in_dw\fP, \fBvideo_in_dh\fP
Display size of the video. Can be different from video size if the
video does not use square pixels (e.g. DVD).
.TP
.B \fBcontainer_fps\fP
FPS value as reported by file headers. This value can be wrong or
completely broken (e.g. 0 or NaN). Even if the value is correct,
if another filter changes the real FPS (by dropping or inserting
frames), the value of this variable might not be useful. Note that
the \fB\-\-fps\fP command line option overrides this value.
.sp
Useful for some filters which insist on having a FPS.
.TP
.B \fBdisplay_fps\fP
Refresh rate of the current display. Note that this value can be 0.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBvapoursynth\-lazy\fP
The same as \fBvapoursynth\fP, but doesn\(aqt load Python scripts. Instead, a
custom backend using Lua and the raw VapourSynth API is used. The syntax
is completely different, and absolutely no convenience features are
provided. There\(aqs no type checking either, and you can trigger crashes.

.SH COMMAND INTERFACE
.sp
The mpv core can be controlled with commands and properties. A number of ways
to interact with the player use them: key bindings (\fBinput.conf\fP), OSD
(showing information with properties), JSON IPC, the client API (\fBlibmpv\fP),
and the classic slave mode.
.SS input.conf
.sp
The input.conf file consists of a list of key bindings, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
s screenshot      # take a screenshot with the s key
LEFT seek 15      # map the left\-arrow key to seeking forward by 15 seconds
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each line maps a key to an input command. Keys are specified with their literal
value (upper case if combined with \fBShift\fP), or a name for special keys. For
example, \fBa\fP maps to the \fBa\fP key without shift, and \fBA\fP maps to \fBa\fP
with shift.
.sp
The file is located in the mpv configuration directory (normally at
\fB~/.config/mpv/input.conf\fP depending on platform). The default bindings are
defined here:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
https://github.com/mpv\-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf

.sp
A list of special keys can be obtained with
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBmpv \-\-input\-keylist\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In general, keys can be combined with \fBShift\fP, \fBCtrl\fP and \fBAlt\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ctrl+q quit
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpv\fP can be started in input test mode, which displays key bindings and the
commands they\(aqre bound to on the OSD, instead of executing the commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mpv \-\-input\-test \-\-force\-window \-\-idle
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Only closing the window will make \fBmpv\fP exit, pressing normal keys will
merely display the binding, even if mapped to quit.)
.SS General Input Command Syntax
.sp
\fB[Shift+][Ctrl+][Alt+][Meta+]<key> [{<section>}] [<prefixes>] <command> (<argument>)* [; <command>]\fP
.sp
Note that by default, the right Alt key can be used to create special
characters, and thus does not register as a modifier. The option
\fB\-\-no\-input\-right\-alt\-gr\fP changes this behavior.
.sp
Newlines always start a new binding. \fB#\fP starts a comment (outside of quoted
string arguments). To bind commands to the \fB#\fP key, \fBSHARP\fP can be used.
.sp
\fB<key>\fP is either the literal character the key produces (ASCII or Unicode
character), or a symbolic name (as printed by \fB\-\-input\-keylist\fP).
.sp
\fB<section>\fP (braced with \fB{\fP and \fB}\fP) is the input section for this
command.
.sp
Arguments are separated by whitespace. This applies even to string arguments.
For this reason, string arguments should be quoted with \fB"\fP\&. Inside quotes,
C\-style escaping can be used.
.sp
You can bind multiple commands to one key. For example:
.nf
a show\-text "command 1" ; show\-text "command 2"
.fi
.sp
.sp
It\(aqs also possible to bind a command to a sequence of keys:
.nf
a\-b\-c show\-text "command run after a, b, c have been pressed"
.fi
.sp
.sp
(This is not shown in the general command syntax.)
.sp
If \fBa\fP or \fBa\-b\fP or \fBb\fP are already bound, this will run the first command
that matches, and the multi\-key command will never be called. Intermediate keys
can be remapped to \fBignore\fP in order to avoid this issue. The maximum number
of (non\-modifier) keys for combinations is currently 4.
.SS List of Input Commands
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBignore\fP
Use this to "block" keys that should be unbound, and do nothing. Useful for
disabling default bindings, without disabling all bindings with
\fB\-\-no\-input\-default\-bindings\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBseek <seconds> [relative|absolute|absolute\-percent|relative\-percent|exact|keyframes]\fP
Change the playback position. By default, seeks by a relative amount of
seconds.
.sp
The second argument consists of flags controlling the seek mode:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B relative (default)
Seek relative to current position (a negative value seeks backwards).
.TP
.B absolute
Seek to a given time (a negative value starts from the end of the file).
.TP
.B absolute\-percent
Seek to a given percent position.
.TP
.B relative\-percent
Seek relative to current position in percent.
.TP
.B keyframes
Always restart playback at keyframe boundaries (fast).
.TP
.B exact
Always do exact/hr/precise seeks (slow).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Multiple flags can be combined, e.g.: \fBabsolute+keyframes\fP\&.
.sp
By default, \fBkeyframes\fP is used for relative seeks, and \fBexact\fP is used
for absolute seeks.
.sp
Before mpv 0.9, the \fBkeyframes\fP and \fBexact\fP flags had to be passed as
3rd parameter (essentially using a space instead of \fB+\fP). The 3rd
parameter is still parsed, but is considered deprecated.
.TP
.B \fBrevert\-seek [mode]\fP
Undoes the \fBseek\fP command, and some other commands that seek (but not
necessarily all of them). Calling this command once will jump to the
playback position before the seek. Calling it a second time undoes the
\fBrevert\-seek\fP command itself. This only works within a single file.
.sp
The first argument is optional, and can change the behavior:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B mark
Mark the current time position. The next normal \fBrevert\-seek\fP command
will seek back to this point, no matter how many seeks happened since
last time.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using it without any arguments gives you the default behavior.
.TP
.B \fBframe\-step\fP
Play one frame, then pause. Does nothing with audio\-only playback.
.TP
.B \fBframe\-back\-step\fP
Go back by one frame, then pause. Note that this can be very slow (it tries
to be precise, not fast), and sometimes fails to behave as expected. How
well this works depends on whether precise seeking works correctly (e.g.
see the \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-demuxer\-offset\fP option). Video filters or other video
post\-processing that modifies timing of frames (e.g. deinterlacing) should
usually work, but might make backstepping silently behave incorrectly in
corner cases. Using \fB\-\-hr\-seek\-framedrop=no\fP should help, although it
might make precise seeking slower.
.sp
This does not work with audio\-only playback.
.TP
.B \fBset <property> "<value>"\fP
Set the given property to the given value.
.TP
.B \fBadd <property> [<value>]\fP
Add the given value to the property. On overflow or underflow, clamp the
property to the maximum. If \fB<value>\fP is omitted, assume \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcycle <property> [up|down]\fP
Cycle the given property. \fBup\fP and \fBdown\fP set the cycle direction. On
overflow, set the property back to the minimum, on underflow set it to the
maximum. If \fBup\fP or \fBdown\fP is omitted, assume \fBup\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmultiply <property> <factor>\fP
Multiplies the value of a property with the numeric factor.
.TP
.B \fBscreenshot [subtitles|video|window|single|each\-frame]\fP
Take a screenshot.
.sp
Multiple flags are available (some can be combined with \fB+\fP):
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <subtitles> (default)
Save the video image, in its original resolution, and with subtitles.
Some video outputs may still include the OSD in the output under certain
circumstances.
.TP
.B <video>
Like \fBsubtitles\fP, but typically without OSD or subtitles. The exact
behavior depends on the selected video output.
.TP
.B <window>
Save the contents of the mpv window. Typically scaled, with OSD and
subtitles. The exact behavior depends on the selected video output, and
if no support is available, this will act like \fBvideo\fP\&.
.TP
.B <each\-frame>
Take a screenshot each frame. Issue this command again to stop taking
screenshots. Note that you should disable frame\-dropping when using
this mode \- or you might receive duplicate images in cases when a
frame was dropped. This flag can be combined with the other flags,
e.g. \fBvideo+each\-frame\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Older mpv versions required passing \fBsingle\fP and \fBeach\-frame\fP as
second argument (and did not have flags). This syntax is still understood,
but deprecated and might be removed in the future.
.sp
Setting the \fBasync\fP flag will make encoding and writing the actual image
file asynchronous in most cases. (\fBeach\-frame\fP mode ignores this flag
currently.) Requesting async screenshots too early or too often could lead
to the same filenames being chosen, and overwriting each others in undefined
order.
.TP
.B \fBscreenshot\-to\-file "<filename>" [subtitles|video|window]\fP
Take a screenshot and save it to a given file. The format of the file will
be guessed by the extension (and \fB\-\-screenshot\-format\fP is ignored \- the
behavior when the extension is missing or unknown is arbitrary).
.sp
The second argument is like the first argument to \fBscreenshot\fP\&.
.sp
If the file already exists, it\(aqs overwritten.
.sp
Like all input command parameters, the filename is subject to property
expansion as described in \fI\%Property Expansion\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBasync\fP flag has an effect on this command (see \fBscreenshot\fP
command).
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-next [weak|force]\fP
Go to the next entry on the playlist.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B weak (default)
If the last file on the playlist is currently played, do nothing.
.TP
.B force
Terminate playback if there are no more files on the playlist.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-prev [weak|force]\fP
Go to the previous entry on the playlist.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B weak (default)
If the first file on the playlist is currently played, do nothing.
.TP
.B force
Terminate playback if the first file is being played.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBloadfile "<file>" [replace|append|append\-play [options]]\fP
Load the given file and play it.
.sp
Second argument:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <replace> (default)
Stop playback of the current file, and play the new file immediately.
.TP
.B <append>
Append the file to the playlist.
.TP
.B <append\-play>
Append the file, and if nothing is currently playing, start playback.
(Always starts with the added file, even if the playlist was not empty
before running this command.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The third argument is a list of options and values which should be set
while the file is playing. It is of the form \fBopt1=value1,opt2=value2,..\fP\&.
Not all options can be changed this way. Some options require a restart
of the player.
.TP
.B \fBloadlist "<playlist>" [replace|append]\fP
Load the given playlist file (like \fB\-\-playlist\fP).
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-clear\fP
Clear the playlist, except the currently played file.
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-remove current|<index>\fP
Remove the playlist entry at the given index. Index values start counting
with 0. The special value \fBcurrent\fP removes the current entry. Note that
removing the current entry also stops playback and starts playing the next
entry.
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-move <index1> <index2>\fP
Move the playlist entry at index1, so that it takes the place of the
entry index2. (Paradoxically, the moved playlist entry will not have
the index value index2 after moving if index1 was lower than index2,
because index2 refers to the target entry, not the index the entry
will have after moving.)
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-shuffle\fP
Shuffle the playlist. This is similar to what is done on start if the
\fB\-\-shuffle\fP option is used.
.TP
.B \fBrun "command" "arg1" "arg2" ...\fP
Run the given command. Unlike in MPlayer/mplayer2 and earlier versions of
mpv (0.2.x and older), this doesn\(aqt call the shell. Instead, the command
is run directly, with each argument passed separately. Each argument is
expanded like in \fI\%Property Expansion\fP\&. Note that there is a static limit
of (as of this writing) 9 arguments (this limit could be raised on demand).
.sp
The program is run in a detached way. mpv doesn\(aqt wait until the command
is completed, but continues playback right after spawning it.
.sp
To get the old behavior, use \fB/bin/sh\fP and \fB\-c\fP as the first two
arguments.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Example"
.sp
\fBrun "/bin/sh" "\-c" "echo ${title} > /tmp/playing"\fP
.sp
This is not a particularly good example, because it doesn\(aqt handle
escaping, and a specially prepared file might allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary shell commands. It is recommended to write a small
shell script, and call that with \fBrun\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBquit [<code>]\fP
Exit the player. If an argument is given, it\(aqs used as process exit code.
.TP
.B \fBquit\-watch\-later [<code>]\fP
Exit player, and store current playback position. Playing that file later
will seek to the previous position on start. The (optional) argument is
exactly as in the \fBquit\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBsub\-add "<file>" [<flags> [<title> [<lang>]]]\fP
Load the given subtitle file. It is selected as current subtitle after
loading.
.sp
The \fBflags\fP args is one of the following values:
.sp
<select>
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Select the subtitle immediately.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
<auto>
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Don\(aqt select the subtitle. (Or in some special situations, let the
default stream selection mechanism decide.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
<cached>
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Select the subtitle. If a subtitle with the same filename was already
added, that one is selected, instead of loading a duplicate entry.
(In this case, title/language are ignored, and if the was changed since
it was loaded, these changes won\(aqt be reflected.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBtitle\fP argument sets the track title in the UI.
.sp
The \fBlang\fP argument sets the track language, and can also influence
stream selection with \fBflags\fP set to \fBauto\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBsub\-remove [<id>]\fP
Remove the given subtitle track. If the \fBid\fP argument is missing, remove
the current track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)
.TP
.B \fBsub\-reload [<id>]\fP
Reload the given subtitle tracks. If the \fBid\fP argument is missing, reload
the current track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)
.sp
This works by unloading and re\-adding the subtitle track.
.TP
.B \fBsub\-step <skip>\fP
Change subtitle timing such, that the subtitle event after the next
\fB<skip>\fP subtitle events is displayed. \fB<skip>\fP can be negative to step
backwards.
.TP
.B \fBsub\-seek <skip>\fP
Seek to the next (skip set to 1) or the previous (skip set to \-1) subtitle.
This is similar to \fBsub\-step\fP, except that it seeks video and audio
instead of adjusting the subtitle delay.
.sp
For embedded subtitles (like with Matroska), this works only with subtitle
events that have already been displayed, or are within a short prefetch
range.
.TP
.B \fBprint\-text "<string>"\fP
Print text to stdout. The string can contain properties (see
\fI\%Property Expansion\fP).
.TP
.B \fBshow\-text "<string>" [<duration>|\-1 [<level>]]\fP
Show text on the OSD. The string can contain properties, which are expanded
as described in \fI\%Property Expansion\fP\&. This can be used to show playback
time, filename, and so on.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <duration>
The time in ms to show the message for. By default, it uses the same
value as \fB\-\-osd\-duration\fP\&.
.TP
.B <level>
The minimum OSD level to show the text at (see \fB\-\-osd\-level\fP).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBexpand\-text "<string>"\fP
Property\-expand the argument and return the expanded string. This can be
used only through the client API or from a script using
\fBmp.command_native\fP\&. (see \fI\%Property Expansion\fP).
.TP
.B \fBshow\-progress\fP
Show the progress bar, the elapsed time and the total duration of the file
on the OSD.
.TP
.B \fBwrite\-watch\-later\-config\fP
Write the resume config file that the \fBquit\-watch\-later\fP command writes,
but continue playback normally.
.TP
.B \fBstop\fP
Stop playback and clear playlist. With default settings, this is
essentially like \fBquit\fP\&. Useful for the client API: playback can be
stopped without terminating the player.
.TP
.B \fBmouse <x> <y> [<button> [single|double]]\fP
Send a mouse event with given coordinate (\fB<x>\fP, \fB<y>\fP).
.sp
Second argument:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <button>
The button number of clicked mouse button. This should be one of 0\-19.
If \fB<button>\fP is omitted, only the position will be updated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Third argument:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <single> (default)
The mouse event represents regular single click.
.TP
.B <double>
The mouse event represents double\-click.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBkeypress <key_name>\fP
Send a key event through mpv\(aqs input handler, triggering whatever
behavior is configured to that key. \fBkey_name\fP uses the \fBinput.conf\fP
naming scheme for keys and modifiers. Useful for the client API: key events
can be sent to libmpv to handle internally.
.TP
.B \fBkeydown <key_name>\fP
Similar to \fBkeypress\fP, but sets the \fBKEYDOWN\fP flag so that if the key is
bound to a repeatable command, it will be run repeatedly with mpv\(aqs key
repeat timing until the \fBkeyup\fP command is called.
.TP
.B \fBkeyup [<key_name>]\fP
Set the \fBKEYUP\fP flag, stopping any repeated behavior that had been
triggered. \fBkey_name\fP is optional. If \fBkey_name\fP is not given or is an
empty string, \fBKEYUP\fP will be set on all keys. Otherwise, \fBKEYUP\fP will
only be set on the key specified by \fBkey_name\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-add "<file>" [<flags> [<title> [<lang>]]]\fP
Load the given audio file. See \fBsub\-add\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-remove [<id>]\fP
Remove the given audio track. See \fBsub\-remove\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-reload [<id>]\fP
Reload the given audio tracks. See \fBsub\-reload\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBrescan\-external\-files [<mode>]\fP
Rescan external files according to the current \fB\-\-sub\-auto\fP and
\fB\-\-audio\-file\-auto\fP settings. This can be used to auto\-load external
files \fIafter\fP the file was loaded.
.sp
The \fBmode\fP argument is one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <reselect> (default)
Select the default audio and subtitle streams, which typically selects
external files with the highest preference. (The implementation is not
perfect, and could be improved on request.)
.TP
.B <keep\-selection>
Do not change current track selections.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Input Commands that are Possibly Subject to Change
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBaf set|add|toggle|del|clr "filter1=params,filter2,..."\fP
Change audio filter chain. See \fBvf\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBvf set|add|toggle|del|clr "filter1=params,filter2,..."\fP
Change video filter chain.
.sp
The first argument decides what happens:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B set
Overwrite the previous filter chain with the new one.
.TP
.B add
Append the new filter chain to the previous one.
.TP
.B toggle
Check if the given filter (with the exact parameters) is already
in the video chain. If yes, remove the filter. If no, add the filter.
(If several filters are passed to the command, this is done for
each filter.)
.sp
A special variant is combining this with labels, and using \fB@name\fP
without filter name and parameters as filter entry. This toggles the
enable/disable flag.
.TP
.B del
Remove the given filters from the video chain. Unlike in the other
cases, the second parameter is a comma separated list of filter names
or integer indexes. \fB0\fP would denote the first filter. Negative
indexes start from the last filter, and \fB\-1\fP denotes the last
filter.
.TP
.B clr
Remove all filters. Note that like the other sub\-commands, this does
not control automatically inserted filters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The argument is always needed. E.g. in case of \fBclr\fP use \fBvf clr ""\fP\&.
.sp
You can assign labels to filter by prefixing them with \fB@name:\fP (where
\fBname\fP is a user\-chosen arbitrary identifier). Labels can be used to
refer to filters by name in all of the filter chain modification commands.
For \fBadd\fP, using an already used label will replace the existing filter.
.sp
The \fBvf\fP command shows the list of requested filters on the OSD after
changing the filter chain. This is roughly equivalent to
\fBshow\-text ${vf}\fP\&. Note that auto\-inserted filters for format conversion
are not shown on the list, only what was requested by the user.
.sp
Normally, the commands will check whether the video chain is recreated
successfully, and will undo the operation on failure. If the command is run
before video is configured (can happen if the command is run immediately
after opening a file and before a video frame is decoded), this check can\(aqt
be run. Then it can happen that creating the video chain fails.

.TP
.B \fBcycle\-values ["!reverse"] <property> "<value1>" "<value2>" ...\fP
Cycle through a list of values. Each invocation of the command will set the
given property to the next value in the list. The command will use the
current value of the property/option, and use it to determine the current
position in the list of values. Once it has found it, it will set the
next value in the list (wrapping around to the first item if needed).
.sp
The special argument \fB!reverse\fP can be used to cycle the value list in
reverse. The only advantage is that you don\(aqt need to reverse the value
list yourself when adding a second key binding for cycling backwards.
.TP
.B \fBenable\-section "<section>" [flags]\fP
Enable all key bindings in the named input section.
.sp
The enabled input sections form a stack. Bindings in sections on the top of
the stack are preferred to lower sections. This command puts the section
on top of the stack. If the section was already on the stack, it is
implicitly removed beforehand. (A section cannot be on the stack more than
once.)
.sp
The \fBflags\fP parameter can be a combination (separated by \fB+\fP) of the
following flags:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <exclusive>
All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are disabled.
They will be re\-enabled as soon as all exclusive sections above them
are removed. In other words, the new section shadows all previous
sections.
.TP
.B <allow\-hide\-cursor>
This feature can\(aqt be used through the public API.
.TP
.B <allow\-vo\-dragging>
Same.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBdisable\-section "<section>"\fP
Disable the named input section. Undoes \fBenable\-section\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdefine\-section "<section>" "<contents>" [default|force]\fP
Create a named input section, or replace the contents of an already existing
input section. The \fBcontents\fP parameter uses the same syntax as the
\fBinput.conf\fP file (except that using the section syntax in it is not
allowed), including the need to separate bindings with a newline character.
.sp
If the \fBcontents\fP parameter is an empty string, the section is removed.
.sp
The section with the name \fBdefault\fP is the normal input section.
.sp
In general, input sections have to be enabled with the \fBenable\-section\fP
command, or they are ignored.
.sp
The last parameter has the following meaning:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B <default> (also used if parameter omitted)
Use a key binding defined by this section only if the user hasn\(aqt
already bound this key to a command.
.TP
.B <force>
Always bind a key. (The input section that was made active most recently
wins if there are ambiguities.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a client
API user. If the input section defines \fBscript\-binding\fP commands, it is
also possible to get separate events on key up/down, and relatively detailed
information about the key state. The special key name \fBunmapped\fP can be
used to match any unmapped key.
.TP
.B \fBoverlay\-add <id> <x> <y> "<file>" <offset> "<fmt>" <w> <h> <stride>\fP
Add an OSD overlay sourced from raw data. This might be useful for scripts
and applications controlling mpv, and which want to display things on top
of the video window.
.sp
Overlays are usually displayed in screen resolution, but with some VOs,
the resolution is reduced to that of the video\(aqs. You can read the
\fBosd\-width\fP and \fBosd\-height\fP properties. At least with \fB\-\-vo\-xv\fP and
anamorphic video (such as DVD), \fBosd\-par\fP should be read as well, and the
overlay should be aspect\-compensated.
.sp
\fBid\fP is an integer between 0 and 63 identifying the overlay element. The
ID can be used to add multiple overlay parts, update a part by using this
command with an already existing ID, or to remove a part with
\fBoverlay\-remove\fP\&. Using a previously unused ID will add a new overlay,
while reusing an ID will update it.
.sp
\fBx\fP and \fBy\fP specify the position where the OSD should be displayed.
.sp
\fBfile\fP specifies the file the raw image data is read from. It can be
either a numeric UNIX file descriptor prefixed with \fB@\fP (e.g. \fB@4\fP),
or a filename. The file will be mapped into memory with \fBmmap()\fP,
copied, and unmapped before the command returns (changed in mpv 0.18.1).
.sp
It is also possible to pass a raw memory address for use as bitmap memory
by passing a memory address as integer prefixed with an \fB&\fP character.
Passing the wrong thing here will crash the player. This mode might be
useful for use with libmpv. The \fBoffset\fP parameter is simply added to the
memory address (since mpv 0.8.0, ignored before).
.sp
\fBoffset\fP is the byte offset of the first pixel in the source file.
(The current implementation always mmap\(aqs the whole file from position 0 to
the end of the image, so large offsets should be avoided. Before mpv 0.8.0,
the offset was actually passed directly to \fBmmap\fP, but it was changed to
make using it easier.)
.sp
\fBfmt\fP is a string identifying the image format. Currently, only \fBbgra\fP
is defined. This format has 4 bytes per pixels, with 8 bits per component.
The least significant 8 bits are blue, and the most significant 8 bits
are alpha (in little endian, the components are B\-G\-R\-A, with B as first
byte). This uses premultiplied alpha: every color component is already
multiplied with the alpha component. This means the numeric value of each
component is equal to or smaller than the alpha component. (Violating this
rule will lead to different results with different VOs: numeric overflows
resulting from blending broken alpha values is considered something that
shouldn\(aqt happen, and consequently implementations don\(aqt ensure that you
get predictable behavior in this case.)
.sp
\fBw\fP, \fBh\fP, and \fBstride\fP specify the size of the overlay. \fBw\fP is the
visible width of the overlay, while \fBstride\fP gives the width in bytes in
memory. In the simple case, and with the \fBbgra\fP format, \fBstride==4*w\fP\&.
In general, the total amount of memory accessed is \fBstride * h\fP\&.
(Technically, the minimum size would be \fBstride * (h \- 1) + w * 4\fP, but
for simplicity, the player will access all \fBstride * h\fP bytes.)
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Before mpv 0.18.1, you had to do manual "double buffering" when updating
an overlay by replacing it with a different memory buffer. Since mpv
0.18.1, the memory is simply copied and doesn\(aqt reference any of the
memory indicated by the command\(aqs arguments after the commend returns.
If you want to use this command before mpv 0.18.1, reads the old docs
to see how to handle this correctly.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBoverlay\-remove <id>\fP
Remove an overlay added with \fBoverlay\-add\fP and the same ID. Does nothing
if no overlay with this ID exists.
.TP
.B \fBscript\-message "<arg1>" "<arg2>" ...\fP
Send a message to all clients, and pass it the following list of arguments.
What this message means, how many arguments it takes, and what the arguments
mean is fully up to the receiver and the sender. Every client receives the
message, so be careful about name clashes (or use \fBscript\-message\-to\fP).
.TP
.B \fBscript\-message\-to "<target>" "<arg1>" "<arg2>" ...\fP
Same as \fBscript\-message\fP, but send it only to the client named
\fB<target>\fP\&. Each client (scripts etc.) has a unique name. For example,
Lua scripts can get their name via \fBmp.get_script_name()\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBscript\-binding "<name>"\fP
Invoke a script\-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key
bindings provided by external Lua scripts.
.sp
The argument is the name of the binding.
.sp
It can optionally be prefixed with the name of the script, using \fB/\fP as
separator, e.g. \fBscript\-binding scriptname/bindingname\fP\&.
.sp
For completeness, here is how this command works internally. The details
could change any time. On any matching key event, \fBscript\-message\-to\fP
or \fBscript\-message\fP is called (depending on whether the script name is
included), with the following arguments:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
The string \fBkey\-binding\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
The name of the binding (as established above).
.IP 3. 3
The key state as string (see below).
.IP 4. 3
The key name (since mpv 0.15.0).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The key state consists of 2 letters:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
One of \fBd\fP (key was pressed down), \fBu\fP (was released), \fBr\fP (key
is still down, and was repeated; only if key repeat is enabled for this
binding), \fBp\fP (key was pressed; happens if up/down can\(aqt be tracked).
.IP 2. 3
Whether the event originates from the mouse, either \fBm\fP (mouse button)
or \fB\-\fP (something else).
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBab\-loop\fP
Cycle through A\-B loop states. The first command will set the \fBA\fP point
(the \fBab\-loop\-a\fP property); the second the \fBB\fP point, and the third
will clear both points.
.TP
.B \fBdrop\-buffers\fP
Drop audio/video/demuxer buffers, and restart from fresh. Might help with
unseekable streams that are going out of sync.
This command might be changed or removed in the future.
.TP
.B \fBscreenshot\-raw [subtitles|video|window]\fP
Return a screenshot in memory. This can be used only through the client
API. The MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP returned by this command has the \fBw\fP, \fBh\fP,
\fBstride\fP fields set to obvious contents. The \fBformat\fP field is set to
\fBbgr0\fP by default. This format is organized as \fBB8G8R8X8\fP (where \fBB\fP
is the LSB). The contents of the padding \fBX\fP are undefined. The \fBdata\fP
field is of type MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY with the actual image data. The image
is freed as soon as the result mpv_node is freed. As usual with client API
semantics, you are not allowed to write to the image data.
.TP
.B \fBvf\-command "<label>" "<cmd>" "<args>"\fP
Send a command to the filter with the given \fB<label>\fP\&. Use \fBall\fP to send
it to all filters at once. The command and argument string is filter
specific. Currently, this only works with the \fBlavfi\fP filter \- see
the libavfilter documentation for which commands a filter supports.
.sp
Note that the \fB<label>\fP is a mpv filter label, not a libavfilter filter
name.
.TP
.B \fBaf\-command "<label>" "<cmd>" "<args>"\fP
Same as \fBvf\-command\fP, but for audio filters.
.TP
.B \fBapply\-profile "<name>"\fP
Apply the contents of a named profile. This is like using \fBprofile=name\fP
in a config file, except you can map it to a key binding to change it at
runtime.
.sp
There is no such thing as "unapplying" a profile \- applying a profile
merely sets all option values listed within the profile.
.TP
.B \fBload\-script "<path>"\fP
Load a script, similar to the \fB\-\-script\fP option. Whether this waits for
the script to finish initialization or not changed multiple times, and the
future behavior is left undefined.
.TP
.B \fBchange\-list "<option>" "<operation>" "<value>"\fP
This command changes list options as described in \fI\%List Options\fP\&. The
\fB<option>\fP parameter is the normal option name, while \fB<operation>\fP is
the suffix or action used on the option.
.sp
Some operations take no value, but the command still requires the value
parameter. In these cases, the value must be an empty string.
.INDENT 7.0

.SS Hooks
.sp
Hooks are synchronous events between player core and a script or similar. This
applies to client API (including the Lua scripting interface). Normally,
events are supposed to be asynchronous, and the hook API provides an awkward
and obscure way to handle events that require stricter coordination. There are
no API stability guarantees made. Not following the protocol exactly can make
the player freeze randomly. Basically, nobody should use this API.
.sp
The C API is described in the header files. The Lua API is described in the
Lua section.
.sp
The following hooks are currently defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBon_load\fP
Called when a file is to be opened, before anything is actually done.
For example, you could read and write the \fBstream\-open\-filename\fP
property to redirect an URL to something else (consider support for
streaming sites which rarely give the user a direct media URL), or
you could set per\-file options with by setting the property
\fBfile\-local\-options/<option name>\fP\&. The player will wait until all
hooks are run.
.TP
.B \fBon_load_fail\fP
Called after after a file has been opened, but failed to. This can be
used to provide a fallback in case native demuxers failed to recognize
the file, instead of always running before the native demuxers like
\fBon_load\fP\&. Demux will only be retried if \fBstream\-open\-filename\fP
was changed.
.TP
.B \fBon_preloaded\fP
Called after a file has been opened, and before tracks are selected and
decoders are created. This has some usefulness if an API users wants
to select tracks manually, based on the set of available tracks. It\(aqs
also useful to initialize \fB\-\-lavfi\-complex\fP in a specific way by API,
without having to "probe" the available streams at first.
.sp
Note that this does not yet apply default track selection. Which operations
exactly can be done and not be done, and what information is available and
what is not yet available yet, is all subject to change.
.TP
.B \fBon_unload\fP
Run before closing a file, and before actually uninitializing
everything. It\(aqs not possible to resume playback in this state.
.UNINDENT
.SS Legacy hook API
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The legacy API is deprecated and will be removed soon.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are two special commands involved. Also, the client must listen for
client messages (\fBMPV_EVENT_CLIENT_MESSAGE\fP in the C API).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBhook\-add <hook\-name> <id> <priority>\fP
Subscribe to the hook identified by the first argument (basically, the
name of event). The \fBid\fP argument is an arbitrary integer chosen by the
user. \fBpriority\fP is used to sort all hook handlers globally across all
clients. Each client can register multiple hook handlers (even for the
same hook\-name). Once the hook is registered, it cannot be unregistered.
.sp
When a specific event happens, all registered handlers are run serially.
This uses a protocol every client has to follow explicitly. When a hook
handler is run, a client message (\fBMPV_EVENT_CLIENT_MESSAGE\fP) is sent to
the client which registered the hook. This message has the following
arguments:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
the string \fBhook_run\fP
.IP 2. 3
the \fBid\fP argument the hook was registered with as string (this can be
used to correctly handle multiple hooks registered by the same client,
as long as the \fBid\fP argument is unique in the client)
.IP 3. 3
something undefined, used by the hook mechanism to track hook execution
.UNINDENT
.sp
Upon receiving this message, the client can handle the event. While doing
this, the player core will still react to requests, but playback will
typically be stopped.
.sp
When the client is done, it must continue the core\(aqs hook execution by
running the \fBhook\-ack\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBhook\-ack <string>\fP
Run the next hook in the global chain of hooks. The argument is the 3rd
argument of the client message that starts hook execution for the
current client.
.UNINDENT
.SS Input Command Prefixes
.sp
These prefixes are placed between key name and the actual command. Multiple
prefixes can be specified. They are separated by whitespace.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBosd\-auto\fP
Use the default behavior for this command. This is the default for
\fBinput.conf\fP commands. Some libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs do not use this as
default, but use \fBno\-osd\fP instead.
.TP
.B \fBno\-osd\fP
Do not use any OSD for this command.
.TP
.B \fBosd\-bar\fP
If possible, show a bar with this command. Seek commands will show the
progress bar, property changing commands may show the newly set value.
.TP
.B \fBosd\-msg\fP
If possible, show an OSD message with this command. Seek command show
the current playback time, property changing commands show the newly set
value as text.
.TP
.B \fBosd\-msg\-bar\fP
Combine osd\-bar and osd\-msg.
.TP
.B \fBraw\fP
Do not expand properties in string arguments. (Like \fB"${property\-name}"\fP\&.)
This is the default for some libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs.
.TP
.B \fBexpand\-properties\fP
All string arguments are expanded as described in \fI\%Property Expansion\fP\&.
This is the default for \fBinput.conf\fP commands.
.TP
.B \fBrepeatable\fP
For some commands, keeping a key pressed doesn\(aqt run the command repeatedly.
This prefix forces enabling key repeat in any case.
.TP
.B \fBasync\fP
Allow asynchronous execution (if possible). Note that only a few commands
will support this (usually this is explicitly documented). Some commands
are asynchronous by default (or rather, their effects might manifest
after completion of the command). The semantics of this flag might change
in the future. Set it only if you don\(aqt rely on the effects of this command
being fully realized when it returns.
.UNINDENT
.sp
All of the osd prefixes are still overridden by the global \fB\-\-osd\-level\fP
settings.
.SS Input Sections
.sp
Input sections group a set of bindings, and enable or disable them at once.
In \fBinput.conf\fP, each key binding is assigned to an input section, rather
than actually having explicit text sections.
.sp
See also: \fBenable\-section\fP and \fBdisable\-section\fP commands.
.sp
Predefined bindings:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdefault\fP
Bindings without input section are implicitly assigned to this section. It
is enabled by default during normal playback.
.TP
.B \fBencode\fP
Section which is active in encoding mode. It is enabled exclusively, so
that bindings in the \fBdefault\fP sections are ignored.
.UNINDENT
.SS Properties
.sp
Properties are used to set mpv options during runtime, or to query arbitrary
information. They can be manipulated with the \fBset\fP/\fBadd\fP/\fBcycle\fP
commands, and retrieved with \fBshow\-text\fP, or anything else that uses property
expansion. (See \fI\%Property Expansion\fP\&.)
.sp
The property name is annotated with RW to indicate whether the property is
generally writable.
.sp
If an option is referenced, the property will normally take/return exactly the
same values as the option. In these cases, properties are merely a way to change
an option at runtime.
.SS Property list

Most options can be set as runtime via properties as well. Just remove the

very different behavior from the options are documented below.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-speed\-correction\fP, \fBvideo\-speed\-correction\fP
Factor multiplied with \fBspeed\fP at which the player attempts to play the
file. Usually it\(aqs exactly 1. (Display sync mode will make this useful.)
.sp
OSD formatting will display it in the form of \fB+1.23456%\fP, with the number
being \fB(raw \- 1) * 100\fP for the given raw property value.
.TP
.B \fBdisplay\-sync\-active\fP
Return whether \fB\-\-video\-sync=display\fP is actually active.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Currently played file, with path stripped. If this is an URL, try to undo
percent encoding as well. (The result is not necessarily correct, but
looks better for display purposes. Use the \fBpath\fP property to get an
unmodified filename.)
.sp
This has a sub\-property:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBfilename/no\-ext\fP
Like the \fBfilename\fP property, but if the text contains a \fB\&.\fP, strip
all text after the last \fB\&.\fP\&. Usually this removes the file extension.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBfile\-size\fP
Length in bytes of the source file/stream. (This is the same as
\fB${stream\-end}\fP\&. For segmented/multi\-part files, this will return the
size of the main or manifest file, whatever it is.)
.TP
.B \fBestimated\-frame\-count\fP
Total number of frames in current file.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

quantities: fps and possibly rounded timestamps.)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBpath\fP
Full path of the currently played file. Usually this is exactly the same
string you pass on the mpv command line or the \fBloadfile\fP command, even
if it\(aqs a relative path. If you expect an absolute path, you will have to
determine it yourself, for example by using the \fBworking\-directory\fP
property.
.TP
.B \fBmedia\-title\fP
If the currently played file has a \fBtitle\fP tag, use that.
.sp
Otherwise, if the media type is DVD, return the volume ID of DVD.
.sp
Otherwise, return the \fBfilename\fP property.
.TP
.B \fBfile\-format\fP
Symbolic name of the file format. In some cases, this is a comma\-separated
list of format names, e.g. mp4 is \fBmov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2\fP (the list
may grow in the future for any format).
.TP
.B \fBcurrent\-demuxer\fP
Name of the current demuxer. (This is useless.)
.sp
(Renamed from \fBdemuxer\fP\&.)
.TP
.B \fBstream\-path\fP
Filename (full path) of the stream layer filename. (This is probably
useless and is almost never different from \fBpath\fP\&.)
.TP
.B \fBstream\-pos\fP
Raw byte position in source stream. Technically, this returns the position
of the most recent packet passed to a decoder.
.TP
.B \fBstream\-end\fP
Raw end position in bytes in source stream.
.TP
.B \fBduration\fP
Duration of the current file in seconds. If the duration is unknown, the
property is unavailable. Note that the file duration is not always exactly
known, so this is an estimate.
.sp
This replaces the \fBlength\fP property, which was deprecated after the
mpv 0.9 release. (The semantics are the same.)
.TP
.B \fBavsync\fP
Last A/V synchronization difference. Unavailable if audio or video is
disabled.
.TP
.B \fBtotal\-avsync\-change\fP
Total A\-V sync correction done. Unavailable if audio or video is
disabled.
.TP
.B \fBdecoder\-frame\-drop\-count\fP
Video frames dropped by decoder, because video is too far behind audio (when
using \fB\-\-framedrop=decoder\fP). Sometimes, this may be incremented in other
situations, e.g. when video packets are damaged, or the decoder doesn\(aqt
follow the usual rules. Unavailable if video is disabled.
.sp
\fBdrop\-frame\-count\fP is a deprecated alias.
.TP
.B \fBframe\-drop\-count\fP
Frames dropped by VO (when using \fB\-\-framedrop=vo\fP).
.sp
\fBvo\-drop\-frame\-count\fP is a deprecated alias.
.TP
.B \fBmistimed\-frame\-count\fP
Number of video frames that were not timed correctly in display\-sync mode
for the sake of keeping A/V sync. This does not include external
circumstances, such as video rendering being too slow or the graphics
driver somehow skipping a vsync. It does not include rounding errors either
(which can happen especially with bad source timestamps). For example,
using the \fBdisplay\-desync\fP mode should never change this value from 0.
.TP
.B \fBvsync\-ratio\fP
For how many vsyncs a frame is displayed on average. This is available if
display\-sync is active only. For 30 FPS video on a 60 Hz screen, this will
be 2. This is the moving average of what actually has been scheduled, so
24 FPS on 60 Hz will never remain exactly on 2.5, but jitter depending on
the last frame displayed.
.TP
.B \fBvo\-delayed\-frame\-count\fP
Estimated number of frames delayed due to external circumstances in
display\-sync mode. Note that in general, mpv has to guess that this is
happening, and the guess can be inaccurate.
.TP
.B \fBpercent\-pos\fP (RW)
Position in current file (0\-100). The advantage over using this instead of
calculating it out of other properties is that it properly falls back to
estimating the playback position from the byte position, if the file
duration is not known.
.TP
.B \fBtime\-pos\fP (RW)
Position in current file in seconds.
.TP
.B \fBtime\-start\fP
Deprecated. Always returns 0. Before mpv 0.14, this used to return the start
time of the file (could affect e.g. transport streams). See
\fB\-\-rebase\-start\-time\fP option.
.TP
.B \fBtime\-remaining\fP
Remaining length of the file in seconds. Note that the file duration is not
always exactly known, so this is an estimate.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-pts\fP (R)
Current audio playback position in current file in seconds. Unlike time\-pos,
this updates more often than once per frame. For audio\-only files, it is
mostly equivalent to time\-pos, while for video\-only files this property is
not available.
.TP
.B \fBplaytime\-remaining\fP
\fBtime\-remaining\fP scaled by the current \fBspeed\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBplayback\-time\fP (RW)
Position in current file in seconds. Unlike \fBtime\-pos\fP, the time is
clamped to the range of the file. (Inaccurate file durations etc. could
make it go out of range. Useful on attempts to seek outside of the file,
as the seek target time is considered the current position during seeking.)
.TP
.B \fBchapter\fP (RW)
Current chapter number. The number of the first chapter is 0.
.TP
.B \fBedition\fP (RW)
Current MKV edition number. Setting this property to a different value will
restart playback. The number of the first edition is 0.
.TP
.B \fBdisc\-titles\fP
Number of BD/DVD titles.
.sp
This has a number of sub\-properties. Replace \fBN\fP with the 0\-based edition
index.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdisc\-titles/count\fP
Number of titles.
.TP
.B \fBdisc\-titles/id\fP
Title ID as integer. Currently, this is the same as the title index.

Metadata key/value pairs.
.sp
If the property is accessed with Lua\(aqs \fBmp.get_property_native\fP, this
returns a table with metadata keys mapping to metadata values. If it is
accessed with the client API, this returns a \fBMPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP\fP,
with tag keys mapping to tag values.
.sp
For OSD, it returns a formatted list. Trying to retrieve this property as

.TP
.B \fBchapter\-metadata\fP
Metadata of current chapter. Works similar to \fBmetadata\fP property. It
also allows the same access methods (using sub\-properties).
.sp
Per\-chapter metadata is very rare. Usually, only the chapter name
(\fBtitle\fP) is set.
.sp
For accessing other information, like chapter start, see the
\fBchapter\-list\fP property.
.TP
.B \fBvf\-metadata/<filter\-label>\fP
Metadata added by video filters. Accessed by the filter label,
which, if not explicitly specified using the \fB@filter\-label:\fP syntax,
will be \fB<filter\-name>NN\fP\&.
.sp
Works similar to \fBmetadata\fP property. It allows the same access
methods (using sub\-properties).
.sp
An example of this kind of metadata are the cropping parameters
added by \fB\-\-vf=lavfi=cropdetect\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBaf\-metadata/<filter\-label>\fP
Equivalent to \fBvf\-metadata/<filter\-label>\fP, but for audio filters.
.TP
.B \fBidle\-active\fP
Return \fByes\fP if no file is loaded, but the player is staying around
because of the \fB\-\-idle\fP option.
.sp
(Renamed from \fBidle\fP\&.)
.TP
.B \fBcore\-idle\fP
Return \fByes\fP if the playback core is paused, otherwise \fBno\fP\&. This can
be different \fBpause\fP in special situations, such as when the player
pauses itself due to low network cache.
.sp
This also returns \fByes\fP if playback is restarting or if nothing is
playing at all. In other words, it\(aqs only \fBno\fP if there\(aqs actually
video playing. (Behavior since mpv 0.7.0.)
.TP
.B \fBcache\fP
Network cache fill state (0\-100.0).
.TP
.B \fBcache\-size\fP (RW)
Network cache size in KB. This is similar to \fB\-\-cache\fP\&. This allows
setting the cache size at runtime. Currently, it\(aqs not possible to enable
or disable the cache at runtime using this property, just to resize an
existing cache.
.sp
This does not include the backbuffer size (changed after mpv 0.10.0).
.sp
Note that this tries to keep the cache contents as far as possible. To make
this easier, the cache resizing code will allocate the new cache while the
old cache is still allocated.
.sp
Don\(aqt use this when playing DVD or Blu\-ray.
.TP
.B \fBcache\-free\fP (R)
Total free cache size in KB.
.TP
.B \fBcache\-used\fP (R)
Total used cache size in KB.
.TP
.B \fBcache\-speed\fP (R)
Current I/O read speed between the cache and the lower layer (like network).
This gives the number bytes per seconds over a 1 second window (using
the type \fBMPV_FORMAT_INT64\fP for the client API).
.TP
.B \fBcache\-idle\fP (R)
Returns \fByes\fP if the cache is idle, which means the cache is filled as
much as possible, and is currently not reading more data.
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-cache\-duration\fP
Approximate duration of video buffered in the demuxer, in seconds. The
guess is very unreliable, and often the property will not be available
at all, even if data is buffered.
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-cache\-time\fP
Approximate time of video buffered in the demuxer, in seconds. Same as
\fBdemuxer\-cache\-duration\fP but returns the last timestamp of buffered
data in demuxer.
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-cache\-idle\fP
Returns \fByes\fP if the demuxer is idle, which means the demuxer cache is
filled to the requested amount, and is currently not reading more data.
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-cache\-state\fP
Various undocumented or half\-documented things.
.sp
Each entry in \fBseekable\-ranges\fP represents a region in the demuxer cache
that can be seeked to. If there are multiple demuxers active, this only
returns information about the "main" demuxer, but might be changed in
future to return unified information about all demuxers. The ranges are in
arbitrary order. Often, ranges will overlap for a bit, before being joined.
In broken corner cases, ranges may overlap all over the place.
.sp
The end of a seek range is usually smaller than the value returned by the
\fBdemuxer\-cache\-time\fP property, because that property returns the guessed
buffering amount, while the seek ranges represent the buffered data that
can actually be used for cached seeking.
.sp
\fBfw\-bytes\fP is the number of bytes of packets buffered in the range
starting from the current decoding position.
.sp
When querying the property with the client API using \fBMPV_FORMAT_NODE\fP,

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-via\-network\fP
Returns \fByes\fP if the stream demuxed via the main demuxer is most likely
played via network. What constitutes "network" is not always clear, might
be used for other types of untrusted streams, could be wrong in certain
cases, and its definition might be changing. Also, external files (like
separate audio files or streams) do not influence the value of this
property (currently).
.TP
.B \fBdemuxer\-start\-time\fP (R)
Returns the start time reported by the demuxer in fractional seconds.
.TP
.B \fBpaused\-for\-cache\fP

.TP
.B \fBcache\-buffering\-state\fP
Return the percentage (0\-100) of the cache fill status until the player
will unpause (related to \fBpaused\-for\-cache\fP).
.TP
.B \fBeof\-reached\fP
Returns \fByes\fP if end of playback was reached, \fBno\fP otherwise. Note
that this is usually interesting only if \fB\-\-keep\-open\fP is enabled,
since otherwise the player will immediately play the next file (or exit
or enter idle mode), and in these cases the \fBeof\-reached\fP property will
logically be cleared immediately after it\(aqs set.
.TP
.B \fBseeking\fP
Returns \fByes\fP if the player is currently seeking, or otherwise trying
to restart playback. (It\(aqs possible that it returns \fByes\fP while a file
is loadedThis is because the same underlying code is used for seeking and
resyncing.)
.TP
.B \fBmixer\-active\fP
Return \fByes\fP if the audio mixer is active, \fBno\fP otherwise.
.sp
This option is relatively useless. Before mpv 0.18.1, it could be used to
infer behavior of the \fBvolume\fP property.
.TP
.B \fBao\-volume\fP (RW)
System volume. This property is available only if mpv audio output is
currently active, and only if the underlying implementation supports volume
control. What this option does depends on the API. For example, on ALSA
this usually changes system\-wide audio, while with PulseAudio this controls
per\-application volume.
.TP
.B \fBao\-mute\fP (RW)
Similar to \fBao\-volume\fP, but controls the mute state. May be unimplemented
even if \fBao\-volume\fP works.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-codec\fP
Audio codec selected for decoding.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-codec\-name\fP

.TP
.B \fBaudio\-params\fP
Audio format as output by the audio decoder.
This has a number of sub\-properties:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-params/format\fP
The sample format as string. This uses the same names as used in other
places of mpv.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-params/samplerate\fP
Samplerate.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-params/channels\fP
The channel layout as a string. This is similar to what the
\fB\-\-audio\-channels\fP accepts.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-params/hr\-channels\fP
As \fBchannels\fP, but instead of the possibly cryptic actual layout
sent to the audio device, return a hopefully more human readable form.
(Usually only \fBaudio\-out\-params/hr\-channels\fP makes sense.)

.B \fBhwdec\fP (RW)
Reflects the \fB\-\-hwdec\fP option.
.sp
Writing to it may change the currently used hardware decoder, if possible.
(Internally, the player may reinitialize the decoder, and will perform a
seek to refresh the video properly.) You can watch the other hwdec
properties to see whether this was successful.
.sp
Unlike in mpv 0.9.x and before, this does not return the currently active
hardware decoder. Since mpv 0.18.0, \fBhwdec\-current\fP is available for
this purpose.
.TP
.B \fBhwdec\-current\fP
Return the current hardware decoding in use. If decoding is active, return
one of the values used by the \fBhwdec\fP option/property. \fBno\fP indicates
software decoding. If no decoder is loaded, the property is unavailable.
.TP
.B \fBhwdec\-interop\fP
This returns the currently loaded hardware decoding/output interop driver.
This is known only once the VO has opened (and possibly later). With some
VOs (like \fBgpu\fP), this might be never known in advance, but only when
the decoder attempted to create the hw decoder successfully. (Using
\fB\-\-gpu\-hwdec\-interop\fP can load it eagerly.) If there are multiple
drivers loaded, they will be separated by \fB,\fP\&.
.sp
If no VO is active or no interop driver is known, this property is
unavailable.

This does not necessarily use the same values as \fBhwdec\fP\&. There can be
multiple interop drivers for the same hardware decoder, depending on
platform and VO.
.TP
.B \fBvideo\-format\fP
Video format as string.
.TP
.B \fBvideo\-codec\fP
Video codec selected for decoding.

Video parameters, as output by the decoder (with overrides like aspect

The pixel format as string. This uses the same names as used in other
places of mpv.
.TP
.B \fBvideo\-params/average\-bpp\fP
Average bits\-per\-pixel as integer. Subsampled planar formats use a
different resolution, which is the reason this value can sometimes be
odd or confusing. Can be unavailable with some formats.

.B \fBvideo\-params/plane\-depth\fP
Bit depth for each color component as integer. This is only exposed

.sp
(Renamed from \fBfps\fP\&.)
.TP
.B \fBestimated\-vf\-fps\fP
Estimated/measured FPS of the video filter chain output. (If no filters
are used, this corresponds to decoder output.) This uses the average of
the 10 past frame durations to calculate the FPS. It will be inaccurate
if frame\-dropping is involved (such as when framedrop is explicitly
enabled, or after precise seeking). Files with imprecise timestamps (such
as Matroska) might lead to unstable results.
.TP
.B \fBwindow\-scale\fP (RW)
Window size multiplier. Setting this will resize the video window to the
values contained in \fBdwidth\fP and \fBdheight\fP multiplied with the value
set with this property. Setting \fB1\fP will resize to original video size
(or to be exact, the size the video filters output). \fB2\fP will set the

.TP
.B \fBwindow\-minimized\fP
Return whether the video window is minimized or not.
.TP
.B \fBdisplay\-names\fP
Names of the displays that the mpv window covers. On X11, these
are the xrandr names (LVDS1, HDMI1, DP1, VGA1, etc.). On Windows, these
are the GDI names (\e.DISPLAY1, \e.DISPLAY2, etc.) and the first display
in the list will be the one that Windows considers associated with the

.B \fBvideo\-bitrate\fP, \fBaudio\-bitrate\fP, \fBsub\-bitrate\fP
Bitrate values calculated on the packet level. This works by dividing the
bit size of all packets between two keyframes by their presentation
timestamp distance. (This uses the timestamps are stored in the file, so
e.g. playback speed does not influence the returned values.) In particular,
the video bitrate will update only per keyframe, and show the "past"
bitrate. To make the property more UI friendly, updates to these properties
are throttled in a certain way.
.sp
The unit is bits per second. OSD formatting turns these values in kilobits
(or megabits, if appropriate), which can be prevented by using the
raw property value, e.g. with \fB${=video\-bitrate}\fP\&.
.sp
Note that the accuracy of these properties is influenced by a few factors.
If the underlying demuxer rewrites the packets on demuxing (done for some
file formats), the bitrate might be slightly off. If timestamps are bad
or jittery (like in Matroska), even constant bitrate streams might show
fluctuating bitrate.
.sp
How exactly these values are calculated might change in the future.

.TP
.B \fBoption\-info/<name>/set\-locally\fP
Return \fByes\fP if the option was set per\-file. This is the case with
automatically loaded profiles, file\-dir configs, and other cases. It

start when playback ends.

.TP
.B \fBoption\-info/<name>/choices\fP
If the option is a choice option, the possible choices. Choices that
are integers may or may not be included (they can be implied by \fBmin\fP

Option changes at runtime are affected by this as well.
.TP
.B \fBvideo\-aspect\fP

a special value (like \fBno\fP, values \fB<= 0\fP) will make the property
set this as option, and return whatever actual aspect was derived from the
option setting.
.TP

an invalid value, instead of the option value.
.TP
.B \fBvf\fP, \fBaf\fP

reinitialize, the new value will be rejected. Setting the option or
setting the property outside of playback will always succeed/fail in the

command\-line interface easier, each \fB\-\-audio\-file=...\fP option appends
the full string to the internal list. However, when used as properties,
every time you set the property as a string the internal list will be
replaced with a single entry containing the string you set. \fB,\fP or other
separators are never used. You have to use \fBMPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY\fP (or
corresponding API, e.g. \fBmp.set_property_native()\fP with a table in Lua)
to set multiple entries.
.sp
Strictly speaking, option access via API (e.g. \fBmpv_set_option_string()\fP)
has the same problem, and it\(aqs only a difference between CLI/API.
.TP
.B \fBplaylist\-pos\fP, \fBchapter\fP
These properties behave different from the deprecated options with the same
names.
.TP
.B \fBprofile\fP, \fBinclude\fP
These are write\-only, and will perform actions as they are written to,
exactly as if they were used on the mpv CLI commandline. Their only use is
when using libmpv before \fBmpv_initialize()\fP, which in turn is probably
only useful in encoding mode. Normal libmpv users should use other
mechanisms, such as the \fBapply\-profile\fP command, and the
\fBmpv_load_config_file\fP API function. Avoid these properties.
.UNINDENT
.SS Property Expansion
.sp
All string arguments to input commands as well as certain options (like
\fB\-\-term\-playing\-msg\fP) are subject to property expansion. Note that property
expansion does not work in places where e.g. numeric parameters are expected.
(For example, the \fBadd\fP command does not do property expansion. The \fBset\fP
command is an exception and not a general rule.)

.sp
Within \fBinput.conf\fP, property expansion can be inhibited by putting the
\fBraw\fP prefix in front of commands.
.sp
The following expansions are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB${NAME}\fP
Expands to the value of the property \fBNAME\fP\&. If retrieving the property
fails, expand to an error string. (Use \fB${NAME:}\fP with a trailing
\fB:\fP to expand to an empty string instead.)
If \fBNAME\fP is prefixed with \fB=\fP, expand to the raw value of the property
(see section below).
.TP
.B \fB${NAME:STR}\fP
Expands to the value of the property \fBNAME\fP, or \fBSTR\fP if the
property cannot be retrieved. \fBSTR\fP is expanded recursively.
.TP
.B \fB${?NAME:STR}\fP
Expands to \fBSTR\fP (recursively) if the property \fBNAME\fP is available.
.TP
.B \fB${!NAME:STR}\fP
Expands to \fBSTR\fP (recursively) if the property \fBNAME\fP cannot be
retrieved.
.TP
.B \fB${?NAME==VALUE:STR}\fP
Expands to \fBSTR\fP (recursively) if the property \fBNAME\fP expands to a
string equal to \fBVALUE\fP\&. You can prefix \fBNAME\fP with \fB=\fP in order to
compare the raw value of a property (see section below). If the property
is unavailable, or other errors happen when retrieving it, the value is
never considered equal.
Note that \fBVALUE\fP can\(aqt contain any of the characters \fB:\fP or \fB}\fP\&.
Also, it is possible that escaping with \fB"\fP or \fB%\fP might be added in
the future, should the need arise.
.TP
.B \fB${!NAME==VALUE:STR}\fP
Same as with the \fB?\fP variant, but \fBSTR\fP is expanded if the value is
not equal. (Using the same semantics as with \fB?\fP\&.)
.TP
.B \fB$$\fP
Expands to \fB$\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB$}\fP
Expands to \fB}\fP\&. (To produce this character inside recursive
expansion.)
.TP
.B \fB$>\fP
Disable property expansion and special handling of \fB$\fP for the rest
of the string.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In places where property expansion is allowed, C\-style escapes are often
accepted as well. Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\en\fP becomes a newline character
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\e\fP expands to \fB\e\fP
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.SS Raw and Formatted Properties
.sp
Normally, properties are formatted as human\-readable text, meant to be
displayed on OSD or on the terminal. It is possible to retrieve an unformatted
(raw) value from a property by prefixing its name with \fB=\fP\&. These raw values
can be parsed by other programs and follow the same conventions as the options
associated with the properties.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Examples"
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB${time\-pos}\fP expands to \fB00:14:23\fP (if playback position is at 14
minutes 23 seconds)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB${=time\-pos}\fP expands to \fB863.4\fP (same time, plus 400 milliseconds \-
milliseconds are normally not shown in the formatted case)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sometimes, the difference in amount of information carried by raw and formatted
property values can be rather big. In some cases, raw values have more
information, like higher precision than seconds with \fBtime\-pos\fP\&. Sometimes
it is the other way around, e.g. \fBaid\fP shows track title and language in the
formatted case, but only the track number if it is raw.
.SH ON SCREEN CONTROLLER
.sp
The On Screen Controller (short: OSC) is a minimal GUI integrated with mpv to
offer basic mouse\-controllability. It is intended to make interaction easier
for new users and to enable precise and direct seeking.
.sp
The OSC is enabled by default if mpv was compiled with Lua support. It can be
disabled entirely using the \fB\-\-osc=no\fP option.
.SS Using the OSC
.sp
By default, the OSC will show up whenever the mouse is moved inside the
player window and will hide if the mouse is not moved outside the OSC for
0.5 seconds or if the mouse leaves the window.

The OSC offers limited configuration through a config file
\fBscript\-opts/osc.conf\fP placed in mpv\(aqs user dir and through the
\fB\-\-script\-opts\fP command\-line option. Options provided through the command\-line
will override those from the config file.
.SS Config Syntax
.sp
The config file must exactly follow the following syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
Controls the mode used to seek when dragging the seekbar. By default,
keyframes are used. If set to false, exact seeking on mouse drags
will be used instead. Keyframes are preferred, but exact seeks may be
useful in cases where keyframes cannot be found. Note that using exact
seeks can potentially make mouse dragging much slower.
.TP
.B \fBdeadzonesize\fP
Default: 0.5
.sp
Size of the deadzone. The deadzone is an area that makes the mouse act
like leaving the window. Movement there won\(aqt make the OSC show up and
it will hide immediately if the mouse enters it. The deadzone starts
at the window border opposite to the OSC and the size controls how much
of the window it will span. Values between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0 means the
OSC will always popup with mouse movement in the window, and 1 means the
OSC will only show up when the mouse hovers it. Default pre\-0.21.0 was 0.

.SH LUA SCRIPTING
.sp
mpv can load Lua scripts. Scripts passed to the \fB\-\-script\fP option, or found in
the \fBscripts\fP subdirectory of the mpv configuration directory (usually
\fB~/.config/mpv/scripts/\fP) will be loaded on program start. mpv also appends the
\fBscripts\fP subdirectory to the end of Lua\(aqs path so you can import scripts from
there too. Since it\(aqs added to the end, don\(aqt name scripts you want to import
the same as Lua libraries because they will be overshadowed by them.
.sp
mpv provides the built\-in module \fBmp\fP, which contains functions to send
commands to the mpv core and to retrieve information about playback state, user
settings, file information, and so on.
.sp
These scripts can be used to control mpv in a similar way to slave mode.
Technically, the Lua code uses the client API internally.
.SS Example
.sp
A script which leaves fullscreen mode when the player is paused:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function on_pause_change(name, value)
    if value == true then
        mp.set_property("fullscreen", "no")
    end
end
mp.observe_property("pause", "bool", on_pause_change)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Details on the script initialization and lifecycle
.sp
Your script will be loaded by the player at program start from the \fBscripts\fP
configuration subdirectory, or from a path specified with the \fB\-\-script\fP
option. Some scripts are loaded internally (like \fB\-\-osc\fP). Each script runs in
its own thread. Your script is first run "as is", and once that is done, the event loop
is entered. This event loop will dispatch events received by mpv and call your
own event handlers which you have registered with \fBmp.register_event\fP, or
timers added with \fBmp.add_timeout\fP or similar. Note that since the
script starts execution concurrently with player initialization, some properties
may not be populated with meaningful values until the relevant subsystems have
initialized.
.sp
When the player quits, all scripts will be asked to terminate. This happens via
a \fBshutdown\fP event, which by default will make the event loop return. If your
script got into an endless loop, mpv will probably behave fine during playback,
but it won\(aqt terminate when quitting, because it\(aqs waiting on your script.
.sp
Internally, the C code will call the Lua function \fBmp_event_loop\fP after
loading a Lua script. This function is normally defined by the default prelude
loaded before your script (see \fBplayer/lua/defaults.lua\fP in the mpv sources).
The event loop will wait for events and dispatch events registered with
\fBmp.register_event\fP\&. It will also handle timers added with \fBmp.add_timeout\fP
and similar (by waiting with a timeout).
.sp
Since mpv 0.6.0, the player will wait until the script is fully loaded before
continuing normal operation. The player considers a script as fully loaded as
soon as it starts waiting for mpv events (or it exits). In practice this means
the player will more or less hang until the script returns from the main chunk
(and \fBmp_event_loop\fP is called), or the script calls \fBmp_event_loop\fP or
\fBmp.dispatch_events\fP directly. This is done to make it possible for a script
to fully setup event handlers etc. before playback actually starts. In older
mpv versions, this happened asynchronously. With mpv 0.29.0, this changes
slightly, and it merely waits for scripts to be loaded in this manner before
starting playback as part of the player initialization phase. Scripts run though
initialization in parallel. This might change again.
.SS mp functions
.sp
The \fBmp\fP module is preloaded, although it can be loaded manually with
\fBrequire \(aqmp\(aq\fP\&. It provides the core client API.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmp.command(string)\fP
Run the given command. This is similar to the commands used in input.conf.
See \fI\%List of Input Commands\fP\&.
.sp
By default, this will show something on the OSD (depending on the command),
as if it was used in \fBinput.conf\fP\&. See \fI\%Input Command Prefixes\fP how
to influence OSD usage per command.
.sp
Returns \fBtrue\fP on success, or \fBnil, error\fP on error.
.TP
.B \fBmp.commandv(arg1, arg2, ...)\fP
Similar to \fBmp.command\fP, but pass each command argument as separate
parameter. This has the advantage that you don\(aqt have to care about
quoting and escaping in some cases.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mp.command("loadfile " .. filename .. " append")
mp.commandv("loadfile", filename, "append")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These two commands are equivalent, except that the first version breaks
if the filename contains spaces or certain special characters.
.sp
Note that properties are \fInot\fP expanded.  You can use either \fBmp.command\fP,
the \fBexpand\-properties\fP prefix, or the \fBmp.get_property\fP family of
functions.
.sp
Unlike \fBmp.command\fP, this will not use OSD by default either (except
for some OSD\-specific commands).
.TP
.B \fBmp.command_native(table [,def])\fP
Similar to \fBmp.commandv\fP, but pass the argument list as table. This has
the advantage that in at least some cases, arguments can be passed as
native types.
.sp
Returns a result table on success (usually empty), or \fBdef, error\fP on
error. \fBdef\fP is the second parameter provided to the function, and is
nil if it\(aqs missing.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_property(name [,def])\fP
Return the value of the given property as string. These are the same
properties as used in input.conf. See \fI\%Properties\fP for a list of
properties. The returned string is formatted similar to \fB${=name}\fP
(see \fI\%Property Expansion\fP).
.sp
Returns the string on success, or \fBdef, error\fP on error. \fBdef\fP is the
second parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it\(aqs missing.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_property_osd(name [,def])\fP
Similar to \fBmp.get_property\fP, but return the property value formatted for
OSD. This is the same string as printed with \fB${name}\fP when used in
input.conf.
.sp
Returns the string on success, or \fBdef, error\fP on error. \fBdef\fP is the
second parameter provided to the function, and is an empty string if it\(aqs
missing. Unlike \fBget_property()\fP, assigning the return value to a variable
will always result in a string.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_property_bool(name [,def])\fP
Similar to \fBmp.get_property\fP, but return the property value as Boolean.
.sp
Returns a Boolean on success, or \fBdef, error\fP on error.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_property_number(name [,def])\fP
Similar to \fBmp.get_property\fP, but return the property value as number.
.sp
Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats,
mpv internals do. This function simply request a double float from mpv,
and mpv will usually convert integer property values to float.
.sp
Returns a number on success, or \fBdef, error\fP on error.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_property_native(name [,def])\fP
Similar to \fBmp.get_property\fP, but return the property value using the best
Lua type for the property. Most time, this will return a string, Boolean,
or number. Some properties (for example \fBchapter\-list\fP) are returned as
tables.
.sp
Returns a value on success, or \fBdef, error\fP on error. Note that \fBnil\fP
might be a possible, valid value too in some corner cases.
.TP
.B \fBmp.set_property(name, value)\fP
Set the given property to the given string value. See \fBmp.get_property\fP
and \fI\%Properties\fP for more information about properties.
.sp
Returns true on success, or \fBnil, error\fP on error.
.TP
.B \fBmp.set_property_bool(name, value)\fP
Similar to \fBmp.set_property\fP, but set the given property to the given
Boolean value.
.TP
.B \fBmp.set_property_number(name, value)\fP
Similar to \fBmp.set_property\fP, but set the given property to the given
numeric value.
.sp
Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats,
mpv internals do. This function will test whether the number can be
represented as integer, and if so, it will pass an integer value to mpv,
otherwise a double float.
.TP
.B \fBmp.set_property_native(name, value)\fP
Similar to \fBmp.set_property\fP, but set the given property using its native
type.
.sp
Since there are several data types which cannot represented natively in
Lua, this might not always work as expected. For example, while the Lua
wrapper can do some guesswork to decide whether a Lua table is an array
or a map, this would fail with empty tables. Also, there are not many
properties for which it makes sense to use this, instead of
\fBset_property\fP, \fBset_property_bool\fP, \fBset_property_number\fP\&.
For these reasons, this function should probably be avoided for now, except
for properties that use tables natively.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_time()\fP
Return the current mpv internal time in seconds as a number. This is
basically the system time, with an arbitrary offset.
.TP
.B \fBmp.add_key_binding(key, name|fn [,fn [,flags]])\fP
Register callback to be run on a key binding. The binding will be mapped to
the given \fBkey\fP, which is a string describing the physical key. This uses
the same key names as in input.conf, and also allows combinations
(e.g. \fBctrl+a\fP). If the key is empty or \fBnil\fP, no physical key is
registered, but the user still can create own bindings (see below).
.sp
After calling this function, key presses will cause the function \fBfn\fP to
be called (unless the user remapped the key with another binding).
.sp
The \fBname\fP argument should be a short symbolic string. It allows the user
to remap the key binding via input.conf using the \fBscript\-message\fP
command, and the name of the key binding (see below for
an example). The name should be unique across other bindings in the same
script \- if not, the previous binding with the same name will be
overwritten. You can omit the name, in which case a random name is generated
internally.
.sp
The last argument is used for optional flags. This is a table, which can
have the following entries:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrepeatable\fP
If set to \fBtrue\fP, enables key repeat for this specific binding.
.TP
.B \fBcomplex\fP
If set to \fBtrue\fP, then \fBfn\fP is called on both key up and down
events (as well as key repeat, if enabled), with the first
argument being a table. This table has an \fBevent\fP entry, which
is set to one of the strings \fBdown\fP, \fBrepeat\fP, \fBup\fP or
\fBpress\fP (the latter if key up/down can\(aqt be tracked). It further
has an \fBis_mouse\fP entry, which tells whether the event was caused
by a mouse button.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Internally, key bindings are dispatched via the \fBscript\-message\-to\fP or
\fBscript\-binding\fP input commands and \fBmp.register_script_message\fP\&.
.sp
Trying to map multiple commands to a key will essentially prefer a random
binding, while the other bindings are not called. It is guaranteed that
user defined bindings in the central input.conf are preferred over bindings
added with this function (but see \fBmp.add_forced_key_binding\fP).
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function something_handler()
    print("the key was pressed")
end
mp.add_key_binding("x", "something", something_handler)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will print the message \fBthe key was pressed\fP when \fBx\fP was pressed.
.sp
The user can remap these key bindings. Then the user has to put the
following into their input.conf to remap the command to the \fBy\fP key:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
y script\-binding something
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will print the message when the key \fBy\fP is pressed. (\fBx\fP will
still work, unless the user remaps it.)
.sp
You can also explicitly send a message to a named script only. Assume the
above script was using the filename \fBfooscript.lua\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
y script\-binding fooscript/something
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBmp.add_forced_key_binding(...)\fP
This works almost the same as \fBmp.add_key_binding\fP, but registers the
key binding in a way that will overwrite the user\(aqs custom bindings in their
input.conf. (\fBmp.add_key_binding\fP overwrites default key bindings only,
but not those by the user\(aqs input.conf.)
.TP
.B \fBmp.remove_key_binding(name)\fP
Remove a key binding added with \fBmp.add_key_binding\fP or
\fBmp.add_forced_key_binding\fP\&. Use the same name as you used when adding
the bindings. It\(aqs not possible to remove bindings for which you omitted
the name.
.TP
.B \fBmp.register_event(name, fn)\fP
Call a specific function when an event happens. The event name is a string,
and the function fn is a Lua function value.
.sp
Some events have associated data. This is put into a Lua table and passed
as argument to fn. The Lua table by default contains a \fBname\fP field,
which is a string containing the event name. If the event has an error
associated, the \fBerror\fP field is set to a string describing the error,
on success it\(aqs not set.
.sp
If multiple functions are registered for the same event, they are run in
registration order, which the first registered function running before all
the other ones.
.sp
Returns true if such an event exists, false otherwise.
.sp
See \fI\%Events\fP and \fI\%List of events\fP for details.
.TP
.B \fBmp.unregister_event(fn)\fP
Undo \fBmp.register_event(..., fn)\fP\&. This removes all event handlers that
are equal to the \fBfn\fP parameter. This uses normal Lua \fB==\fP comparison,
so be careful when dealing with closures.
.TP
.B \fBmp.observe_property(name, type, fn)\fP
Watch a property for changes. If the property \fBname\fP is changed, then
the function \fBfn(name)\fP will be called. \fBtype\fP can be \fBnil\fP, or be
set to one of \fBnone\fP, \fBnative\fP, \fBbool\fP, \fBstring\fP, or \fBnumber\fP\&.
\fBnone\fP is the same as \fBnil\fP\&. For all other values, the new value of
the property will be passed as second argument to \fBfn\fP, using
\fBmp.get_property_<type>\fP to retrieve it. This means if \fBtype\fP is for
example \fBstring\fP, \fBfn\fP is roughly called as in
\fBfn(name, mp.get_property_string(name))\fP\&.
.sp
If possible, change events are coalesced. If a property is changed a bunch
of times in a row, only the last change triggers the change function. (The
exact behavior depends on timing and other things.)
.sp
In some cases the function is not called even if the property changes.
Whether this can happen depends on the property.
.sp
If the \fBtype\fP is \fBnone\fP or \fBnil\fP, sporadic property change events are
possible. This means the change function \fBfn\fP can be called even if the
property doesn\(aqt actually change.
.TP
.B \fBmp.unobserve_property(fn)\fP
Undo \fBmp.observe_property(..., fn)\fP\&. This removes all property handlers
that are equal to the \fBfn\fP parameter. This uses normal Lua \fB==\fP
comparison, so be careful when dealing with closures.
.TP
.B \fBmp.add_timeout(seconds, fn)\fP
Call the given function fn when the given number of seconds has elapsed.
Note that the number of seconds can be fractional. For now, the timer\(aqs
resolution may be as low as 50 ms, although this will be improved in the
future.
.sp
This is a one\-shot timer: it will be removed when it\(aqs fired.
.sp
Returns a timer object. See \fBmp.add_periodic_timer\fP for details.
.TP
.B \fBmp.add_periodic_timer(seconds, fn)\fP
Call the given function periodically. This is like \fBmp.add_timeout\fP, but
the timer is re\-added after the function fn is run.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Returns a timer object. The timer object provides the following methods:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBstop()\fP
Disable the timer. Does nothing if the timer is already disabled.
This will remember the current elapsed time when stopping, so that
\fBresume()\fP essentially unpauses the timer.
.TP
.B \fBkill()\fP
Disable the timer. Resets the elapsed time. \fBresume()\fP will
restart the timer.
.TP
.B \fBresume()\fP
Restart the timer. If the timer was disabled with \fBstop()\fP, this
will resume at the time it was stopped. If the timer was disabled
with \fBkill()\fP, or if it\(aqs a previously fired one\-shot timer (added
with \fBadd_timeout()\fP), this starts the timer from the beginning,
using the initially configured timeout.
.TP
.B \fBis_enabled()\fP
Whether the timer is currently enabled or was previously disabled
(e.g. by \fBstop()\fP or \fBkill()\fP).
.TP
.B \fBtimeout\fP (RW)
This field contains the current timeout period. This value is not
updated as time progresses. It\(aqs only used to calculate when the
timer should fire next when the timer expires.
.sp
If you write this, you can call \fBt:kill() ; t:resume()\fP to reset
the current timeout to the new one. (\fBt:stop()\fP won\(aqt use the
new timeout.)
.TP
.B \fBoneshot\fP (RW)
Whether the timer is periodic (\fBfalse\fP) or fires just once
(\fBtrue\fP). This value is used when the timer expires (but before
the timer callback function fn is run).
.UNINDENT

.B \fBmp.get_opt(key)\fP
Return a setting from the \fB\-\-script\-opts\fP option. It\(aqs up to the user and
the script how this mechanism is used. Currently, all scripts can access
this equally, so you should be careful about collisions.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_script_name()\fP
Return the name of the current script. The name is usually made of the
filename of the script, with directory and file extension removed. If
there are several scripts which would have the same name, it\(aqs made unique
by appending a number.

.B \fBmp.suspend()\fP
This function has been deprecated in mpv 0.21.0 and does nothing starting
with mpv 0.23.0 (no replacement).

.B \fBmp.resume()\fP
This function has been deprecated in mpv 0.21.0 and does nothing starting

This function has been deprecated in mpv 0.21.0 and does nothing starting
with mpv 0.23.0 (no replacement).
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_wakeup_pipe()\fP
Calls \fBmpv_get_wakeup_pipe()\fP and returns the read end of the wakeup
pipe. This is deprecated, but still works. (See \fBclient.h\fP for details.)
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_next_timeout()\fP
Return the relative time in seconds when the next timer (\fBmp.add_timeout\fP
and similar) expires. If there is no timer, return \fBnil\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmp.dispatch_events([allow_wait])\fP
This can be used to run custom event loops. If you want to have direct
control what the Lua script does (instead of being called by the default
event loop), you can set the global variable \fBmp_event_loop\fP to your
own function running the event loop. From your event loop, you should call
\fBmp.dispatch_events()\fP to dequeue and dispatch mpv events.
.sp
If the \fBallow_wait\fP parameter is set to \fBtrue\fP, the function will block
until the next event is received or the next timer expires. Otherwise (and
this is the default behavior), it returns as soon as the event loop is
emptied. It\(aqs strongly recommended to use \fBmp.get_next_timeout()\fP and
\fBmp.get_wakeup_pipe()\fP if you\(aqre interested in properly working
notification of new events and working timers.
.TP
.B \fBmp.register_idle(fn)\fP
Register an event loop idle handler. Idle handlers are called before the
script goes to sleep after handling all new events. This can be used for
example to delay processing of property change events: if you\(aqre observing
multiple properties at once, you might not want to act on each property
change, but only when all change notifications have been received.
.TP
.B \fBmp.unregister_idle(fn)\fP
Undo \fBmp.register_idle(fn)\fP\&. This removes all idle handlers that
are equal to the \fBfn\fP parameter. This uses normal Lua \fB==\fP comparison,
so be careful when dealing with closures.
.TP
.B \fBmp.enable_messages(level)\fP
Set the minimum log level of which mpv message output to receive. These
messages are normally printed to the terminal. By calling this function,
you can set the minimum log level of messages which should be received with
the \fBlog\-message\fP event. See the description of this event for details.
The level is a string, see \fBmsg.log\fP for allowed log levels.
.TP
.B \fBmp.register_script_message(name, fn)\fP
This is a helper to dispatch \fBscript\-message\fP or \fBscript\-message\-to\fP
invocations to Lua functions. \fBfn\fP is called if \fBscript\-message\fP or
\fBscript\-message\-to\fP (with this script as destination) is run
with \fBname\fP as first parameter. The other parameters are passed to \fBfn\fP\&.
If a message with the given name is already registered, it\(aqs overwritten.
.sp
Used by \fBmp.add_key_binding\fP, so be careful about name collisions.
.TP
.B \fBmp.unregister_script_message(name)\fP
Undo a previous registration with \fBmp.register_script_message\fP\&. Does
nothing if the \fBname\fP wasn\(aqt registered.

The level parameter is the message priority. It\(aqs a string and one of
\fBfatal\fP, \fBerror\fP, \fBwarn\fP, \fBinfo\fP, \fBv\fP, \fBdebug\fP, \fBtrace\fP\&. The
user\(aqs settings will determine which of these messages will be
visible. Normally, all messages are visible, except \fBv\fP, \fBdebug\fP and

.SS mp.options functions
.sp
mpv comes with a built\-in module to manage options from config\-files and the

with values found in the config\-file and the command\-line (in that order).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBoptions.read_options(table [, identifier])\fP
A \fBtable\fP with key\-value pairs. The type of the default values is
important for converting the values read from the config file or
command\-line back. Do not use \fBnil\fP as a default value!
.sp
The \fBidentifier\fP is used to identify the config\-file and the command\-line
options. These needs to unique to avoid collisions with other scripts.

playback or goes to the next file while the process is running,
the process will be killed.
.TP
.B \fBmax_size\fP
Optional. The maximum size in bytes of the data that can be captured
from stdout. (Default: 16 MB.)
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
The function returns a table as result with the following entries:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstatus\fP
The raw exit status of the process. It will be negative on error.
.TP
.B \fBstdout\fP
Captured output stream as string, limited to \fBmax_size\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBerror\fP
\fBnil\fP on success. The string \fBkilled\fP if the process was
terminated in an unusual way. The string \fBinit\fP if the process
could not be started.
.sp
On Windows, \fBkilled\fP is only returned when the process has been
killed by mpv as a result of \fBcancellable\fP being set to \fBtrue\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBkilled_by_us\fP
Set to \fBtrue\fP if the process has been killed by mpv as a result
of \fBcancellable\fP being set to \fBtrue\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fButils.subprocess_detached(t)\fP
Runs an external process and detaches it from mpv\(aqs control.
.sp
The parameter \fBt\fP is a table. The function reads the following entries:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBargs\fP
Array of strings of the same semantics as the \fBargs\fP used in the
\fBsubprocess\fP function.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The function returns \fBnil\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fButils.getpid()\fP
Returns the process ID of the running mpv process. This can be used to identify
the calling mpv when launching (detached) subprocesses.
.TP
.B \fButils.parse_json(str [, trail])\fP
Parses the given string argument as JSON, and returns it as a Lua table. On
error, returns \fBnil, error\fP\&. (Currently, \fBerror\fP is just a string
reading \fBerror\fP, because there is no fine\-grained error reporting of any
kind.)
.sp
The returned value uses similar conventions as \fBmp.get_property_native()\fP
to distinguish empty objects and arrays.
.sp
If the \fBtrail\fP parameter is \fBtrue\fP (or any value equal to \fBtrue\fP),
then trailing non\-whitespace text is tolerated by the function, and the
trailing text is returned as 3rd return value. (The 3rd return value is
always there, but with \fBtrail\fP set, no error is raised.)
.TP
.B \fButils.format_json(v)\fP
Format the given Lua table (or value) as a JSON string and return it. On
error, returns \fBnil, error\fP\&. (Errors usually only happen on value types
incompatible with JSON.)
.sp
The argument value uses similar conventions as \fBmp.set_property_native()\fP
to distinguish empty objects and arrays.
.TP
.B \fButils.to_string(v)\fP
Turn the given value into a string. Formats tables and their contents. This
doesn\(aqt do anything special; it is only needed because Lua is terrible.
.UNINDENT
.SS Events
.sp
Events are notifications from player core to scripts. You can register an
event handler with \fBmp.register_event\fP\&.
.sp
Note that all scripts (and other parts of the player) receive events equally,
and there\(aqs no such thing as blocking other scripts from receiving events.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function my_fn(event)
    print("start of playback!")
end

mp.register_event("file\-loaded", my_fn)

.SS List of events
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstart\-file\fP
Happens right before a new file is loaded. When you receive this, the
player is loading the file (or possibly already done with it).
.TP
.B \fBend\-file\fP
Happens after a file was unloaded. Typically, the player will load the
next file right away, or quit if this was the last file.
.sp
The event has the \fBreason\fP field, which takes one of these values:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBeof\fP
The file has ended. This can (but doesn\(aqt have to) include
incomplete files or broken network connections under
circumstances.
.TP
.B \fBstop\fP
Playback was ended by a command.
.TP
.B \fBquit\fP
Playback was ended by sending the quit command.
.TP
.B \fBerror\fP
An error happened. In this case, an \fBerror\fP field is present with
the error string.
.TP
.B \fBredirect\fP
Happens with playlists and similar. Details see
\fBMPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT\fP in the C API.
.TP
.B \fBunknown\fP
Unknown. Normally doesn\(aqt happen, unless the Lua API is out of sync
with the C API. (Likewise, it could happen that your script gets
reason strings that did not exist yet at the time your script was
written.)
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBfile\-loaded\fP
Happens after a file was loaded and begins playback.
.TP
.B \fBseek\fP
Happens on seeking. (This might include cases when the player seeks
internally, even without user interaction. This includes e.g. segment
changes when playing ordered chapters Matroska files.)
.TP
.B \fBplayback\-restart\fP
Start of playback after seek or after file was loaded.
.TP
.B \fBidle\fP
Idle mode is entered. This happens when playback ended, and the player was
started with \fB\-\-idle\fP or \fB\-\-force\-window\fP\&. This mode is implicitly ended
when the \fBstart\-file\fP or \fBshutdown\fP events happen.
.TP
.B \fBtick\fP
Called after a video frame was displayed. This is a hack, and you should
avoid using it. Use timers instead and maybe watch pausing/unpausing events
to avoid wasting CPU when the player is paused.
.TP
.B \fBshutdown\fP
Sent when the player quits, and the script should terminate. Normally
handled automatically. See \fI\%Details on the script initialization and lifecycle\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBlog\-message\fP
Receives messages enabled with \fBmp.enable_messages\fP\&. The message data
is contained in the table passed as first parameter to the event handler.
The table contains, in addition to the default event fields, the following
fields:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBprefix\fP
The module prefix, identifies the sender of the message. This is what
the terminal player puts in front of the message text when using the
\fB\-\-v\fP option, and is also what is used for \fB\-\-msg\-level\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBlevel\fP
The log level as string. See \fBmsg.log\fP for possible log level names.
Note that later versions of mpv might add new levels or remove
(undocumented) existing ones.
.TP
.B \fBtext\fP
The log message. The text will end with a newline character. Sometimes
it can contain multiple lines.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Keep in mind that these messages are meant to be hints for humans. You
should not parse them, and prefix/level/text of messages might change
any time.
.TP
.B \fBget\-property\-reply\fP
Undocumented (not useful for Lua scripts).
.TP
.B \fBset\-property\-reply\fP
Undocumented (not useful for Lua scripts).
.TP
.B \fBcommand\-reply\fP
Undocumented (not useful for Lua scripts).
.TP
.B \fBclient\-message\fP
Undocumented (used internally).
.TP
.B \fBvideo\-reconfig\fP
Happens on video output or filter reconfig.
.TP
.B \fBaudio\-reconfig\fP
Happens on audio output or filter reconfig.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following events also happen, but are deprecated: \fBtracks\-changed\fP,
\fBtrack\-switched\fP, \fBpause\fP, \fBunpause\fP, \fBmetadata\-update\fP,
\fBchapter\-change\fP\&. Use \fBmp.observe_property()\fP instead.
.SS Extras
.sp
This documents experimental features, or features that are "too special" to
guarantee a stable interface.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmp.add_hook(type, priority, fn)\fP
Add a hook callback for \fBtype\fP (a string identifying a certain kind of
hook). These hooks allow the player to call script functions and wait for
their result (normally, the Lua scripting interface is asynchronous from
the point of view of the player core). \fBpriority\fP is an arbitrary integer
that allows ordering among hooks of the same kind. Using the value 50 is
recommended as neutral default value. \fBfn\fP is the function that will be
called during execution of the hook.
.sp
See \fI\%Hooks\fP for currently existing hooks and what they do \- only the hook
list is interesting; handling hook execution is done by the Lua script
function automatically.

.SH JAVASCRIPT
.sp
JavaScript support in mpv is near identical to its Lua support. Use this section
as reference on differences and availability of APIs, but otherwise you should
refer to the Lua documentation for API details and general scripting in mpv.
.SS Example
.sp
JavaScript code which leaves fullscreen mode when the player is paused:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function on_pause_change(name, value) {
    if (value == true)
        mp.set_property("fullscreen", "no");
}
mp.observe_property("pause", "bool", on_pause_change);
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.SS Similarities with Lua
.sp
mpv tries to load a script file as JavaScript if it has a \fB\&.js\fP extension, but
otherwise, the documented Lua options, script directories, loading, etc apply to
JavaScript files too.
.sp
Script initialization and lifecycle is the same as with Lua, and most of the Lua
functions at the modules \fBmp\fP, \fBmp.utils\fP, \fBmp.msg\fP and \fBmp.options\fP are
available to JavaScript with identical APIs \- including running commands,
getting/setting properties, registering events/key\-bindings/hooks, etc.
.SS Differences from Lua
.sp
No need to load modules. \fBmp\fP, \fBmp.utils\fP,  \fBmp.msg\fP and \fBmp.options\fP
are preloaded, and you can use e.g. \fBvar cwd = mp.utils.getcwd();\fP without
prior setup.
.sp
Errors are slightly different. Where the Lua APIs return \fBnil\fP for error,
the JavaScript ones return \fBundefined\fP\&. Where Lua returns \fBsomething, error\fP
JavaScript returns only \fBsomething\fP \- and makes \fBerror\fP available via
\fBmp.last_error()\fP\&. Note that only some of the functions have this additional
\fBerror\fP value \- typically the same ones which have it in Lua.
.sp
Standard APIs are preferred. For instance \fBsetTimeout\fP and \fBJSON.stringify\fP
are available, but \fBmp.add_timeout\fP and \fBmp.utils.format_json\fP are not.
.sp
No standard library. This means that interaction with anything outside of mpv is
limited to the available APIs, typically via \fBmp.utils\fP\&. However, some file
functions were added, and CommonJS \fBrequire\fP is available too \- where the
loaded modules have the same privileges as normal scripts.
.SS Language features \- ECMAScript 5
.sp
The scripting backend which mpv currently uses is MuJS \- a compatible minimal
ES5 interpreter. As such, \fBString.substring\fP is implemented for instance,
while the common but non\-standard \fBString.substr\fP is not. Please consult the
MuJS pages on language features and platform support \- \fI\%http://mujs.com\fP .

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmp.last_error()\fP
If used after an API call which updates last error, returns an empty string
if the API call succeeded, or a non\-empty error reason string otherwise.
.TP
.B \fBError.stack\fP (string)
When using \fBtry { ... } catch(e) { ... }\fP, then \fBe.stack\fP is the stack
trace of the error \- if it was created using the \fBError(...)\fP constructor.
.TP
.B \fBprint\fP (global)
A convenient alias to \fBmp.msg.info\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdump\fP (global)
Like \fBprint\fP but also expands objects and arrays recursively.
.TP
.B \fBmp.utils.getenv(name)\fP
Returns the value of the host environment variable \fBname\fP, or
\fBundefined\fP if the variable is not defined.
.TP
.B \fBmp.utils.get_user_path(path)\fP
Expands (mpv) meta paths like \fB~/x\fP, \fB~~/y\fP, \fB~~desktop/z\fP etc.
\fBread_file\fP, \fBwrite_file\fP and \fBrequire\fP already use this internaly.
.TP

Returns the content of file \fBfname\fP as string. If \fBmax\fP is provided and
not negative, limit the read to \fBmax\fP bytes.
.TP
.B \fBmp.utils.write_file(fname, str)\fP
(Over)write file \fBfname\fP with text content \fBstr\fP\&. \fBfname\fP must be
prefixed with \fBfile://\fP as simple protection against accidental arguments
switch, e.g. \fBmp.utils.write_file("file://~/abc.txt", "hello world")\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: \fBread_file\fP and \fBwrite_file\fP throw on errors, allow text content only.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_time_ms()\fP
Same as \fBmp.get_time()\fP but in ms instead of seconds.
.TP
.B \fBmp.get_script_file()\fP
Returns the file name of the current script.
.TP
.B \fBexit()\fP (global)
Make the script exit at the end of the current event loop iteration.
Note: please remove added key bindings before calling \fBexit()\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBmp.utils.compile_js(fname, content_str)\fP
Compiles the JS code \fBcontent_str\fP as file name \fBfname\fP (without loading
anything from the filesystem), and returns it as a function. Very similar
to a \fBFunction\fP constructor, but shows at stack traces as \fBfname\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Timers (global)
.sp
The standard HTML/node.js timers are available:
.sp
\fBid = setTimeout(fn [,duration [,arg1 [,arg2...]]])\fP
.sp
\fBid = setTimeout(code_string [,duration])\fP
.sp
\fBclearTimeout(id)\fP
.sp
\fBid = setInterval(fn [,duration [,arg1 [,arg2...]]])\fP
.sp
\fBid = setInterval(code_string [,duration])\fP
.sp
\fBclearInterval(id)\fP
.sp
\fBsetTimeout\fP and \fBsetInterval\fP return id, and later call \fBfn\fP (or execute
\fBcode_string\fP) after \fBduration\fP ms. Interval also repeat every \fBduration\fP\&.
.sp
\fBduration\fP has a minimum and default value of 0, \fBcode_string\fP is
a plain string which is evaluated as JS code, and \fB[,arg1 [,arg2..]]\fP are used
as arguments (if provided) when calling back \fBfn\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBclear...(id)\fP functions cancel timer \fBid\fP, and are irreversible.
.sp
Note: timers always call back asynchronously, e.g. \fBsetTimeout(fn)\fP will never
call \fBfn\fP before returning. \fBfn\fP will be called either at the end of this
event loop iteration or at a later event loop iteration. This is true also for
intervals \- which also never call back twice at the same event loop iteration.
.sp
Additionally, timers are processed after the event queue is empty, so it\(aqs valid
to use \fBsetTimeout(fn)\fP as a one\-time idle observer.
.SS CommonJS modules and \fBrequire(id)\fP
.sp
CommonJS Modules are a standard system where scripts can export common functions
for use by other scripts. A module is a script which adds properties (functions,
etc) to its invisible \fBexports\fP object, which another script can access by
loading it with \fBrequire(module\-id)\fP \- which returns that \fBexports\fP object.
.sp
Modules and \fBrequire\fP are supported, standard compliant, and generally similar
to node.js. However, most node.js modules won\(aqt run due to missing modules such
as \fBfs\fP, \fBprocess\fP, etc, but some node.js modules with minimal dependencies
do work. In general, this is for mpv modules and not a node.js replacement.
.sp
A \fB\&.js\fP file extension is always added to \fBid\fP, e.g. \fBrequire("./foo")\fP
will load the file \fB\&./foo.js\fP and return its \fBexports\fP object.
.sp
An id is relative (to the script which \fBrequire\fP\(aqd it) if it starts with
\fB\&./\fP or \fB\&../\fP\&. Otherwise, it\(aqs considered a "top\-level id" (CommonJS term).
.sp
Top level id is evaluated as absolute filesystem path if possible (e.g. \fB/x/y\fP
or \fB~/x\fP). Otherwise, it\(aqs searched at \fBscripts/modules.js/\fP in mpv config
dirs \- in normal config search order. E.g. \fBrequire("x")\fP is searched as file
\fBx.js\fP at those dirs, and id \fBfoo/x\fP is searched as file \fBfoo/x.js\fP\&.
.sp
No \fBglobal\fP variable, but a module\(aqs \fBthis\fP at its top lexical scope is the
global object \- also in strict mode. If you have a module which needs \fBglobal\fP
as the global object, you could do \fBthis.global = this;\fP before \fBrequire\fP\&.
.sp
Functions and variables declared at a module don\(aqt pollute the global object.
.SS The event loop
.sp
The event loop poll/dispatch mpv events as long as the queue is not empty, then
processes the timers, then waits for the next event, and repeats this forever.
.sp
You could put this code at your script to replace the built\-in event loop, and
also print every event which mpv sends to your script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function mp_event_loop() {
    var wait = 0;
    do {
        var e = mp.wait_event(wait);
        dump(e);  // there could be a lot of prints...
        if (e.event != "none") {
            mp.dispatch_event(e);
            wait = 0;
        } else {
            wait = mp.process_timers() / 1000;
            if (wait != 0) {
                mp.notify_idle_observers();
                wait = mp.peek_timers_wait() / 1000;
            }
        }
    } while (mp.keep_running);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmp_event_loop\fP is a name which mpv tries to call after the script loads.
The internal implementation is similar to this (without \fBdump\fP though..).
.sp
\fBe = mp.wait_event(wait)\fP returns when the next mpv event arrives, or after
\fBwait\fP seconds if positive and no mpv events arrived. \fBwait\fP value of 0
returns immediately (with \fBe.event == "none"\fP if the queue is empty).
.sp
\fBmp.dispatch_event(e)\fP calls back the handlers registered for \fBe.event\fP,
if there are such (event handlers, property observers, script messages, etc).
.sp
\fBmp.process_timers()\fP calls back the already\-added, non\-canceled due timers,
and returns the duration in ms till the next due timer (possibly 0), or \-1 if
there are no pending timers. Must not be called recursively.
.sp
\fBmp.notify_idle_observers()\fP calls back the idle observers, which we do when
we\(aqre about to sleep (wait != 0), but the observers may add timers or take
non\-negligible duration to complete, so we re\-calculate \fBwait\fP afterwards.
.sp
\fBmp.peek_timers_wait()\fP returns the same values as \fBmp.process_timers()\fP
but without doing anything. Invalid result if called from a timer callback.
.sp
Note: \fBexit()\fP is also registered for the \fBshutdown\fP event, and its
implementation is a simple \fBmp.keep_running = false\fP\&.
.SH JSON IPC
.sp
mpv can be controlled by external programs using the JSON\-based IPC protocol.
It can be enabled by specifying the path to a unix socket or a named pipe using
the option \fB\-\-input\-ipc\-server\fP\&. Clients can connect to this socket and send
commands to the player or receive events from it.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is not intended to be a secure network protocol. It is explicitly
insecure: there is no authentication, no encryption, and the commands
themselves are insecure too. For example, the \fBrun\fP command is exposed,
which can run arbitrary system commands. The use\-case is controlling the
player locally. This is not different from the MPlayer slave protocol.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Socat example
.sp
You can use the \fBsocat\fP tool to send commands (and receive replies) from the
shell. Assuming mpv was started with:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
mpv file.mkv \-\-input\-ipc\-server=/tmp/mpvsocket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Then you can control it using socat:
.INDENT 0.0

{"data":190.482000,"error":"success"}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, socat copies data between stdin/stdout and the mpv socket
connection.
.sp
See the \fB\-\-idle\fP option how to make mpv start without exiting immediately or
playing a file.
.sp
It\(aqs also possible to send input.conf style text\-only commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> echo \(aqshow\-text ${playback\-time}\(aq | socat \- /tmp/mpvsocket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
But you won\(aqt get a reply over the socket. (This particular command shows the
playback time on the player\(aqs OSD.)
.SS Command Prompt example
.sp
Unfortunately, it\(aqs not as easy to test the IPC protocol on Windows, since
Windows ports of socat (in Cygwin and MSYS2) don\(aqt understand named pipes. In
the absence of a simple tool to send and receive from bidirectional pipes, the
\fBecho\fP command can be used to send commands, but not receive replies from the
command prompt.

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo show\-text ${playback\-time} >\e\e.\epipe\empvsocket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To be able to simultaneously read and write from the IPC pipe, like on Linux,
it\(aqs necessary to write an external program that uses overlapped file I/O (or
some wrapper like .NET\(aqs NamedPipeClientStream.)
.SS Protocol
.sp
Clients can execute commands on the player by sending JSON messages of the
following form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["command_name", "param1", "param2", ...] }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBcommand_name\fP is the name of the command to be executed, followed by a
list of parameters. Parameters must be formatted as native JSON values
(integers, strings, booleans, ...). Every message \fBmust\fP be terminated with
\fB\en\fP\&. Additionally, \fB\en\fP must not appear anywhere inside the message. In
practice this means that messages should be minified before being sent to mpv.
.sp
mpv will then send back a reply indicating whether the command was run
correctly, and an additional field holding the command\-specific return data (it
can also be null).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "error": "success", "data": null }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
mpv will also send events to clients with JSON messages of the following form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "event": "event_name" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBevent_name\fP is the name of the event. Additional event\-specific fields
can also be present. See \fI\%List of events\fP for a list of all supported events.
.sp
Because events can occur at any time, it may be difficult at times to determine
which response goes with which command. Commands may optionally include a
\fBrequest_id\fP which, if provided in the command request, will be copied
verbatim into the response. mpv does not intrepret the \fBrequest_id\fP in any
way; it is solely for the use of the requester.
.sp
For example, this request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["get_property", "time\-pos"], "request_id": 100 }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Would generate this response:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "error": "success", "data": 1.468135, "request_id": 100 }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All commands, replies, and events are separated from each other with a line
break character (\fB\en\fP).
.sp
If the first character (after skipping whitespace) is not \fB{\fP, the command
will be interpreted as non\-JSON text command, as they are used in input.conf
(or \fBmpv_command_string()\fP in the client API). Additionally, lines starting
with \fB#\fP and empty lines are ignored.
.sp
Currently, embedded 0 bytes terminate the current line, but you should not
rely on this.
.SS Commands
.sp
In addition to the commands described in \fI\%List of Input Commands\fP, a few
extra commands can also be used as part of the protocol:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBclient_name\fP
Return the name of the client as string. This is the string \fBipc\-N\fP with
N being an integer number.
.TP
.B \fBget_time_us\fP
Return the current mpv internal time in microseconds as a number. This is
basically the system time, with an arbitrary offset.
.TP
.B \fBget_property\fP
Return the value of the given property. The value will be sent in the data
field of the replay message.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["get_property", "volume"] }
{ "data": 50.0, "error": "success" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBget_property_string\fP
Like \fBget_property\fP, but the resulting data will always be a string.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["get_property_string", "volume"] }
{ "data": "50.000000", "error": "success" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBset_property\fP
Set the given property to the given value. See \fI\%Properties\fP for more
information about properties.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["set_property", "pause", true] }
{ "error": "success" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBset_property_string\fP
Alias for \fBset_property\fP\&. Both commands accept native values and strings.
.TP
.B \fBobserve_property\fP
Watch a property for changes. If the given property is changed, then an
event of type \fBproperty\-change\fP will be generated
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["observe_property", 1, "volume"] }
{ "error": "success" }
{ "event": "property\-change", "id": 1, "data": 52.0, "name": "volume" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the connection is closed, the IPC client is destroyed internally,
and the observed properties are unregistered. This happens for example
when sending commands to a socket with separate \fBsocat\fP invocations.
This can make it seem like property observation does not work. You must
keep the IPC connection open to make it work.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBobserve_property_string\fP
Like \fBobserve_property\fP, but the resulting data will always be a string.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["observe_property_string", 1, "volume"] }
{ "error": "success" }
{ "event": "property\-change", "id": 1, "data": "52.000000", "name": "volume" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBunobserve_property\fP
Undo \fBobserve_property\fP or \fBobserve_property_string\fP\&. This requires the
numeric id passed to the observed command as argument.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "command": ["unobserve_property", 1] }
{ "error": "success" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBrequest_log_messages\fP
Enable output of mpv log messages. They will be received as events. The
parameter to this command is the log\-level (see \fBmpv_request_log_messages\fP
C API function).
.sp
Log message output is meant for humans only (mostly for debugging).
Attempting to retrieve information by parsing these messages will just
lead to breakages with future mpv releases. Instead, make a feature request,
and ask for a proper event that returns the information you need.
.TP
.B \fBenable_event\fP, \fBdisable_event\fP
Enables or disables the named event. Mirrors the \fBmpv_request_event\fP C
API function. If the string \fBall\fP is used instead of an event name, all
events are enabled or disabled.
.sp
By default, most events are enabled, and there is not much use for this
command.
.TP
.B \fBget_version\fP
Returns the client API version the C API of the remote mpv instance
provides.
.sp
See also: \fBDOCS/client\-api\-changes.rst\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS UTF\-8
.sp
Normally, all strings are in UTF\-8. Sometimes it can happen that strings are
in some broken encoding (often happens with file tags and such, and filenames
on many Unixes are not required to be in UTF\-8 either). This means that mpv
sometimes sends invalid JSON. If that is a problem for the client application\(aqs
parser, it should filter the raw data for invalid UTF\-8 sequences and perform
the desired replacement, before feeding the data to its JSON parser.
.sp
mpv will not attempt to construct invalid UTF\-8 with broken escape sequences.
.SH CHANGELOG
.sp
There is no real changelog, but you can look at the following things:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The release changelog, which should contain most user\-visible changes,
including new features and bug fixes:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/mpv\-player/mpv/releases\fP
.IP \(bu 2
The git log, which is the "real" changelog
.IP \(bu 2
The files \fBclient\-api\-changes.rst\fP and \fBinterface\-changes.rst\fP in the
\fBDOCS\fP sub directoryon the git repository, which document API and user
interface changes (the latter usually documents breaking changes only, rather
than additions).
.IP \(bu 2
The file \fBmplayer\-changes.rst\fP in the \fBDOCS\fP sub directory on the git
repository, which used to be in place of this section. It documents some
changes that happened since mplayer2 forked off MPlayer. (Not updated
anymore.)
.UNINDENT
.SH EMBEDDING INTO OTHER PROGRAMS (LIBMPV)
.sp
mpv can be embedded into other programs as video/audio playback backend. The
recommended way to do so is using libmpv. See \fBlibmpv/client.h\fP in the mpv
source code repository. This provides a C API. Bindings for other languages
might be available (see wiki).
.sp
Since libmpv merely allows access to underlying mechanisms that can control
mpv, further documentation is spread over a few places:

.UNINDENT
.SH C PLUGINS
.sp
You can write C plugins for mpv. These use the libmpv API, although they do not
use the libmpv library itself.
.sp
Currently, they must be explicitly enabled at build time with
\fB\-\-enable\-cplugins\fP\&. They are available on Linux/BSD platforms only.
.SS C plugins location
.sp
C plugins are put into the mpv scripts directory in its config directory
(see the \fI\%FILES\fP section for details). They must have a \fB\&.so\fP file extension.
They can also be explicitly loaded with the \fB\-\-script\fP option.
.SS API
.sp
A C plugin must export the following function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
int mpv_open_cplugin(mpv_handle *handle)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The plugin function will be called on loading time. This function does not
return as long as your plugin is loaded (it runs in its own thread). The
\fBhandle\fP will be deallocated as soon as the plugin function returns.
.sp
The return value is interpreted as error status. A value of \fB0\fP is
interpreted as success, while \fB\-1\fP signals an error. In the latter case,
the player prints an uninformative error message that loading failed.
.sp
Return values other than \fB0\fP and \fB\-1\fP are reserved, and trigger undefined
behavior.
.sp
Within the plugin function, you can call libmpv API functions. The \fBhandle\fP
is created by \fBmpv_create_client()\fP (or actually an internal equivalent),
and belongs to you. You can call \fBmpv_wait_event()\fP to wait for things
happening, and so on.
.sp
Note that the player might block until your plugin calls \fBmpv_wait_event()\fP
for the first time. This gives you a chance to install initial hooks etc.
before playback begins.
.sp
The details are quite similar to Lua scripts.
.SS Linkage to libmpv
.sp
The current implementation requires that your plugins are \fBnot\fP linked against
libmpv. What your plugins uses are not symbols from a libmpv binary, but
symbols from the mpv host binary.
.SS Examples
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%https://github.com/mpv\-player/mpv\-examples/tree/master/cplugins\fP
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control the
behavior of mpv.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBHOME\fP, \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP
Used to determine mpv config directory. If \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is not set,
\fB$HOME/.config/mpv\fP is used.
.sp
\fB$HOME/.mpv\fP is always added to the list of config search paths with a
lower priority.
.TP
.B \fBXDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fP
If set, XDG\-style system configuration directories are used. Otherwise,
the UNIX convention (\fBPREFIX/etc/mpv/\fP) is used.
.TP
.B \fBMPV_HOME\fP
Directory where mpv looks for user settings. Overrides \fBHOME\fP, and mpv
will try to load the config file as \fB$MPV_HOME/mpv.conf\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMPV_VERBOSE\fP (see also \fB\-v\fP and \fB\-\-msg\-level\fP)
Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules (default: 0).
This is an integer, and the resulting verbosity corresponds to the number
of \fB\-\-v\fP options passed to the command line.
.TP
.B \fBMPV_LEAK_REPORT\fP
If set to \fB1\fP, enable internal talloc leak reporting.
.TP
.B \fBLADSPA_PATH\fP
Specifies the search path for LADSPA plugins. If it is unset, fully
qualified path names must be used.
.TP
.B \fBDISPLAY\fP
Standard X11 display name to use.
.TP
.B FFmpeg/Libav:
This library accesses various environment variables. However, they are not
centrally documented, and documenting them is not our job. Therefore, this
list is incomplete.
.sp
Notable environment variables:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBhttp_proxy\fP
URL to proxy for \fBhttp://\fP and \fBhttps://\fP URLs.
.TP
.B \fBno_proxy\fP
List of domain patterns for which no proxy should be used.
List entries are separated by \fB,\fP\&. Patterns can include \fB*\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B libdvdcss:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP
Specify a directory in which to store title key values. This will
speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache. The
\fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP directory is created if it does not exist, and a
subdirectory is created named after the DVD\(aqs title or manufacturing
date. If \fBDVDCSS_CACHE\fP is not set or is empty, libdvdcss will use
the default value which is \fB${HOME}/.dvdcss/\fP under Unix and
the roaming application data directory (\fB%APPDATA%\fP) under
Windows. The special value "off" disables caching.
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_METHOD\fP
Sets the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss will use
to read scrambled discs. Can be one of \fBtitle\fP, \fBkey\fP or \fBdisc\fP\&.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B key
is the default method. libdvdcss will use a set of calculated
player keys to try to get the disc key. This can fail if the drive
does not recognize any of the player keys.
.TP
.B disc
is a fallback method when key has failed. Instead of using player
keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key using a brute force
algorithm. This process is CPU intensive and requires 64 MB of
memory to store temporary data.
.TP
.B title
is the fallback when all other methods have failed. It does not
rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto
attack to guess the title key. On rare cases this may fail because
there is not enough encrypted data on the disc to perform a
statistical attack, but on the other hand it is the only way to
decrypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or a DVD with the wrong region
on an RPC2 drive.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE\fP
Specify the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your
operating system, the Linux utility to set up raw devices is raw(8)
for instance. Please note that on most operating systems, using a raw
device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires a 2048 bytes
alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).
.TP
.B \fBDVDCSS_VERBOSE\fP
Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B 0
Outputs no messages at all.
.TP
.B 1
Outputs error messages to stderr.
.TP
.B 2
Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBDVDREAD_NOKEYS\fP
Skip retrieving all keys on startup. Currently disabled.
.TP
.B \fBHOME\fP
FIXME: Document this.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT CODES
.sp
Normally \fBmpv\fP returns 0 as exit code after finishing playback successfully.
If errors happen, the following exit codes can be returned:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 1
Error initializing mpv. This is also returned if unknown options are
passed to mpv.
.TP
.B 2
The file passed to mpv couldn\(aqt be played. This is somewhat fuzzy:
currently, playback of a file is considered to be successful if
initialization was mostly successful, even if playback fails
immediately after initialization.
.TP
.B 3
There were some files that could be played, and some files which
couldn\(aqt (using the definition of success from above).
.TP
.B 4
Quit due to a signal, Ctrl+c in a VO window (by default), or from the
default quit key bindings in encoding mode.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that quitting the player manually will always lead to exit code 0,
overriding the exit code that would be returned normally. Also, the \fBquit\fP
input command can take an exit code: in this case, that exit code is returned.
.SH FILES
.sp
For Windows\-specifics, see \fI\%FILES ON WINDOWS\fP section.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB/usr/local/etc/mpv/mpv.conf\fP
mpv system\-wide settings (depends on \fB\-\-prefix\fP passed to configure \- mpv
in default configuration will use \fB/usr/local/etc/mpv/\fP as config
directory, while most Linux distributions will set it to \fB/etc/mpv/\fP).
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf\fP
mpv user settings (see \fI\%CONFIGURATION FILES\fP section)
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/input.conf\fP
key bindings (see \fI\%INPUT.CONF\fP section)
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/fonts.conf\fP
Fontconfig fonts.conf that is customized for mpv. You should include system
fonts.conf in this file or mpv would not know about fonts that you already
have in the system.
.sp
Only available when libass is built with fontconfig.
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/subfont.ttf\fP
fallback subtitle font
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/fonts/\fP
Font files in this directory are used by mpv/libass for subtitles. Useful
if you do not want to install fonts to your system. Note that files in this
directory are loaded into memory before being used by mpv. If you have a
lot of fonts, consider using fonts.conf (see above) to include additional
fonts, which is more memory\-efficient.
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/scripts/\fP
All files in this directory are loaded as if they were passed to the
\fB\-\-script\fP option. They are loaded in alphabetical order, and sub\-directories
and files with no \fB\&.lua\fP extension are ignored. The \fB\-\-load\-scripts=no\fP
option disables loading these files.
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/watch_later/\fP
Contains temporary config files needed for resuming playback of files with
the watch later feature. See for example the \fBQ\fP key binding, or the
\fBquit\-watch\-later\fP input command.
.sp
Each file is a small config file which is loaded if the corresponding media
file is loaded. It contains the playback position and some (not necessarily
all) settings that were changed during playback. The filenames are hashed
from the full paths of the media files. It\(aqs in general not possible to
extract the media filename from this hash. However, you can set the
\fB\-\-write\-filename\-in\-watch\-later\-config\fP option, and the player will
add the media filename to the contents of the resume config file.
.TP
.B \fB~/.config/mpv/script\-opts/osc.conf\fP
This is loaded by the OSC script. See the \fI\%ON SCREEN CONTROLLER\fP docs
for details.
.sp
Other files in this directory are specific to the corresponding scripts
as well, and the mpv core doesn\(aqt touch them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the environment variables \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP and \fB$MPV_HOME\fP can
override the standard directory \fB~/.config/mpv/\fP\&.
.sp
Also, the old config location at \fB~/.mpv/\fP is still read, and if the XDG
variant does not exist, will still be preferred.
.SH FILES ON WINDOWS
.sp
On win32 (if compiled with MinGW, but not Cygwin), the default config file
locations are different. They are generally located under \fB%APPDATA%/mpv/\fP\&.
For example, the path to mpv.conf is \fB%APPDATA%/mpv/mpv.conf\fP, which maps to
a system and user\-specific path, for example
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBC:\eusers\eUSERNAME\eAppData\eRoaming\empv\empv.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can find the exact path by running \fBecho %APPDATA%\empv\empv.conf\fP in cmd.exe.
.sp
Other config files (such as \fBinput.conf\fP) are in the same directory. See the
\fI\%FILES\fP section above.
.sp
The environment variable \fB$MPV_HOME\fP completely overrides these, like on
UNIX.
.sp
If a directory named \fBportable_config\fP next to the mpv.exe exists, all
config will be loaded from this directory only. Watch later config files are
written to this directory as well. (This exists on Windows only and is redundant
with \fB$MPV_HOME\fP\&. However, since Windows is very scripting unfriendly, a
wrapper script just setting \fB$MPV_HOME\fP, like you could do it on other
systems, won\(aqt work. \fBportable_config\fP is provided for convenience to get
around this restriction.)
.sp
Config files located in the same directory as \fBmpv.exe\fP are loaded with
lower priority. Some config files are loaded only once, which means that
e.g. of 2 \fBinput.conf\fP files located in two config directories, only the
one from the directory with higher priority will be loaded.
.sp
A third config directory with the lowest priority is the directory named \fBmpv\fP
in the same directory as \fBmpv.exe\fP\&. This used to be the directory with the
highest priority, but is now discouraged to use and might be removed in the
future.
.sp
Note that mpv likes to mix \fB/\fP and \fB\e\fP path separators for simplicity.
kernel32.dll accepts this, but cmd.exe does not.
